00:00:11.487 --> 00:00:15.825
OK, we're all set then. Alright,
so this is module 4. We're going

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/22-1
00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:16.417
to cover.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/26-0
00:00:18.777 --> 00:00:19.747
We're going to cover.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/32-0
00:00:20.737 --> 00:00:23.407
Problem based operations for
this module.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/66-0
00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:28.279
Umm, I'm going to cover a little
bit of feedback and a couple of

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/66-1
00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.194
things with the try catch
blocks, but this one is going to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/66-2
00:00:32.194 --> 00:00:36.307
be a specifically about reading
from files writing two files.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/99-0
00:00:37.447 --> 00:00:40.812
Again, this should cover or. I'm
sorry this module, all your

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/99-1
00:00:40.812 --> 00:00:44.121
assignments and everything
should cover the same content or

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/99-2
00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:47.485
same topic, so that should help
with. I guess keeping on the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/99-3
00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:49.857
same page for all the assignment
stuff so.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/107-0
00:00:50.377 --> 00:00:55.167
Umm, the assignments, the
programming ones are similar.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/156-0
00:00:55.997 --> 00:00:59.725
And also different. They both
will do one part of the file

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/156-1
00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:03.643
based operations but one will do
a little bit more. But again

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/156-2
00:01:03.643 --> 00:01:07.560
I'll walk you through a lot of
this in the demo and hopefully

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/156-3
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.909
leave you with enough
information and sort of like a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/156-4
00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.247
template that you can also
complete.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/161-0
00:01:15.177 --> 00:01:16.167
You're going to be assignment.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/169-0
00:01:17.157 --> 00:01:19.247
So alright, let's move along
now.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/224-0
00:01:20.807 --> 00:01:24.363
OK, alright. Not too, brother.
OK, alright. So academic

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/224-1
00:01:24.363 --> 00:01:28.300
integrity usually write about
now is one thing starts to come

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/224-2
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.109
up with academic integrity
violations, specifically dealing

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/224-3
00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.919
with coursework that you find
outside or solutions that you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/224-4
00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:40.046
find outside of the course. I've
mentioned this already. I think

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/224-5
00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:43.856
a couple times at least, but
it's really important that you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/224-6
00:01:43.856 --> 00:01:46.777
don't do it even if you
reference an outside.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/234-0
00:01:47.547 --> 00:01:50.967
Well, reference, I asked if you
reference an outside source.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/284-0
00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:55.190
Uh, from outside of this course
and you reference that in your

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/284-1
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.912
solution that still not correct.
This is obviously not talking

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/284-2
00:01:58.912 --> 00:02:02.576
about discussion posts because
that you should be referencing

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/284-3
00:02:02.576 --> 00:02:06.476
where you're getting information
from as it's typically not gonna

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/284-4
00:02:06.476 --> 00:02:10.317
be your own except for like your
opinion and explanations on it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/304-0
00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:16.011
But for coding assignments
especially, it should be all and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/304-1
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:18.337
Tyler entirely your own work.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/395-0
00:02:19.397 --> 00:02:22.914
With the exception of, if I
provide you something right. So

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/395-1
00:02:22.914 --> 00:02:26.373
if if for the assignment I give
you some of my code for my

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/395-2
00:02:26.373 --> 00:02:30.242
demos, you can use that to piece
together your assignment. If you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/395-3
00:02:30.242 --> 00:02:33.876
see how I'm using something to
find a sorted array or to sort

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/395-4
00:02:33.876 --> 00:02:37.393
numbers that you can use that
because I've given it to you.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/395-5
00:02:37.393 --> 00:02:41.086
Now, if you're looking for this
solution outside of the course

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/395-6
00:02:41.086 --> 00:02:44.897
and you copy that and you paste
it in your assignment and submit

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/395-7
00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:48.179
it as if you had done it
yourself, that's where we have

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/395-8
00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.707
problems.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/426-0
00:02:49.987 --> 00:02:54.183
And I've been teaching this for
a little while now. It's so it's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/426-1
00:02:54.183 --> 00:02:58.314
there's certain things that I'll
see with an assignment that'll

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/426-2
00:02:58.314 --> 00:03:00.057
kind of set off a red flag.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/438-0
00:03:01.927 --> 00:03:05.457
Uh, to kind of let me know that
it was copied so.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/515-0
00:03:08.947 --> 00:03:12.103
Yeah, I I would just say, you
know, avoid it at all costs,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/515-1
00:03:12.103 --> 00:03:15.313
even if it comes from a tutor,
I'm more than happy to help.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/515-2
00:03:15.313 --> 00:03:18.736
I've I've met with a handful of
you now and walked you through.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/515-3
00:03:18.736 --> 00:03:21.893
I mean, anything that you need
help with. So I'm more than

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/515-4
00:03:21.893 --> 00:03:24.888
happy to do that and meet with
you. We've set up a time

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/515-5
00:03:24.888 --> 00:03:28.044
whenever we can and we can go
through things together. I'd

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/515-6
00:03:28.044 --> 00:03:31.147
much rather do that than to have
to have someone resubmit

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/515-7
00:03:31.147 --> 00:03:34.410
assignment or deal with the
academic integrity stuff because

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/515-8
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.406
if it's a blatant copy and
paste, that doesn't look too

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/515-9
00:03:37.406 --> 00:03:38.957
well and it's pretty hard to.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/532-0
00:03:39.077 --> 00:03:42.744
Are you against? So yeah, if you
need any help, let me know. You

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/532-1
00:03:42.744 --> 00:03:45.057
can use some tutoring services
although.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/551-0
00:03:46.657 --> 00:03:49.915
Honestly, from feedback I get,
it's probably just best to reach

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/551-1
00:03:49.915 --> 00:03:53.224
out to me. So alright, hopefully
that clears it up a little bit.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/551-2
00:03:53.224 --> 00:03:54.547
Just don't copy and paste.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/569-0
00:03:56.087 --> 00:04:00.235
OK, Java versus JavaScript. I
see this kind of confused a lot.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/569-1
00:04:00.235 --> 00:04:03.987
Java and JavaScript or if
someone has learned JavaScript

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/569-2
00:04:03.987 --> 00:04:04.777
in the past.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/602-0
00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:09.959
And is kind of getting confused
with some of the terminology.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/602-1
00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.273
Well, that's because Java and
JavaScript are like totally

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/602-2
00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:16.643
different. They're nothing
alike. Ohh I can't remember the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/602-3
00:04:16.643 --> 00:04:18.357
history behind the name of it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/672-0
00:04:19.997 --> 00:04:23.965
But they're they're not the same
languages. Ones made for like

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/672-1
00:04:23.965 --> 00:04:27.555
web-based stuff. The other one
is not really, so they're

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/672-2
00:04:27.555 --> 00:04:31.712
definitely completely different.
If you were to code something in

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/672-3
00:04:31.712 --> 00:04:35.680
JavaScript and submit that, I'm
sorry, but that would not be a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/672-4
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.018
Java program as they're
completely different. So I'm

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/672-5
00:04:39.018 --> 00:04:42.986
just keep that in mind if you
are confused about it, just make

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/672-6
00:04:42.986 --> 00:04:46.702
sure that you are doing your
work in Java. If you're using

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/672-7
00:04:46.702 --> 00:04:47.017
that.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/705-0
00:04:48.647 --> 00:04:52.345
I guess JavaScript language for
any discussion posts just also

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/705-1
00:04:52.345 --> 00:04:55.809
keep in mind that that will
probably be confusing to other

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/705-2
00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:59.037
students as JavaScript does not
look much like Java O.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/739-0
00:05:00.537 --> 00:05:03.529
Just wanted to clear that up,
alright, the discussion

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/739-1
00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:06.687
overview, we're response
requirements first, I just want

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/739-2
00:05:06.687 --> 00:05:10.011
to make sure that everyone is
aware. I do state it you know

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/739-3
00:05:10.011 --> 00:05:12.947
every lecture but it probably
gets missed sometimes.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/774-0
00:05:14.057 --> 00:05:17.175
Your initial discussion post
should be at least two

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/774-1
00:05:17.175 --> 00:05:20.473
paragraphs, and each paragraph
should be at least four

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/774-2
00:05:20.473 --> 00:05:24.190
sentences. So if you think about
it, you should have at least

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/774-3
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.088
eight sentences total. I hate to
be one to, like, be nitpicky at

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/774-4
00:05:28.088 --> 00:05:29.227
counting sentences.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/801-0
00:05:29.747 --> 00:05:33.077
Uh, but when we're doing our
discussions and you're

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/801-1
00:05:33.077 --> 00:05:37.047
submitting a ton of stuff with
lots of code in it, it's gonna

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/801-2
00:05:37.047 --> 00:05:40.632
be best if we do have some sort
of explanation with it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/801-3
00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:41.977
Otherwise we're just.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/836-0
00:05:42.987 --> 00:05:46.372
Putting in a lot of code
examples and nothing else along

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/836-1
00:05:46.372 --> 00:05:50.055
with it, it's kind of hard for
anyone else to understand what

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/836-2
00:05:50.055 --> 00:05:53.500
you're trying to to show
everyone, so it's important that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/836-3
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.697
we at least meet those
requirements.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/893-0
00:05:56.487 --> 00:05:59.140
OK, importance of error
handling. I think everyone did

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/893-1
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.987
pretty good on this. That's
typically how it is with these

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/893-2
00:06:01.987 --> 00:06:05.123
discussions. So I'm usually not
too worried about it, especially

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/893-3
00:06:05.123 --> 00:06:07.969
if we cover the content in
class. I think the first couple

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/893-4
00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.105
of modules are really something
that's like look up on your own.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/893-5
00:06:11.105 --> 00:06:14.289
It doesn't help that the lecture
is also on the night that you're

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/893-6
00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:17.087
supposed to have your initial
discussion post to do, but.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/928-0
00:06:18.047 --> 00:06:21.177
What I'm seeing a lot is pretty
much everyone is, at least on

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/928-1
00:06:21.177 --> 00:06:24.307
the same page with it. There's a
lot of great points that are

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/928-2
00:06:24.307 --> 00:06:27.588
being addressed by a lot of you
in in different perspectives, so

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/928-3
00:06:27.588 --> 00:06:28.497
it's great to see.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/951-0
00:06:29.607 --> 00:06:33.596
Now, along with that topic,
something that I've been asked a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/951-1
00:06:33.596 --> 00:06:37.782
lot is about the different types
of use of try catch blocks and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/951-2
00:06:37.782 --> 00:06:39.417
where to put them really.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/953-0
00:06:40.077 --> 00:06:40.647
Umm.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/957-0
00:06:41.817 --> 00:06:43.107
Let me see here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/959-0
00:06:46.657 --> 00:06:47.247
O.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/974-0
00:06:47.887 --> 00:06:51.560
There's sort of an argument for
whether or not you should put

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/974-1
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.567
try catch blocks.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1032-0
00:06:53.767 --> 00:06:57.326
Essentially around your whole
program. Or do you just put it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1032-1
00:06:57.326 --> 00:07:01.118
around certain sections of code
that you want to do some type of

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1032-2
00:07:01.118 --> 00:07:04.851
calculations for and I'll just
walk you through kind of what it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1032-3
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:08.235
looks like if we are going to
put try catch blocks around

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1032-4
00:07:08.235 --> 00:07:11.852
everything or just different
sections and you'll see how some

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1032-5
00:07:11.852 --> 00:07:15.469
of this can bubble up, you'll
see what I mean by that because

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1032-6
00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:17.277
I reference that or I say that.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1084-0
00:07:17.767 --> 00:07:21.028
Umm, I think I saw that in the
past module the past lecture

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1084-1
00:07:21.028 --> 00:07:24.072
about how you know these
exceptions could bubble up, so

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1084-2
00:07:24.072 --> 00:07:27.279
I'll show you what that looks
like and hopefully this will

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1084-3
00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:30.431
give you a better. I guess
understanding of how this will

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1084-4
00:07:30.431 --> 00:07:33.692
work now in terms of where
should you put it. You typically

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1084-5
00:07:33.692 --> 00:07:36.954
don't want to put all of your
code in a try catch or in the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1084-6
00:07:36.954 --> 00:07:37.497
try block.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1128-0
00:07:39.017 --> 00:07:42.557
But for this course, that's
completely fine. It's really not

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1128-1
00:07:42.557 --> 00:07:46.330
gonna cause a problem. There are
certain use cases where you may

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1128-2
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.103
not want to do that. If you have
a large program and you're just

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1128-3
00:07:50.103 --> 00:07:53.875
constantly putting everything to
try catch blocks a lot of times

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1128-4
00:07:53.875 --> 00:07:56.487
that will create a lot of bloat
or a lot of.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1178-0
00:07:58.067 --> 00:08:01.973
It'll slow things down because
essentially you could be logging

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1178-1
00:08:01.973 --> 00:08:05.757
things in many places and you
really don't have to be. And if

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1178-2
00:08:05.757 --> 00:08:09.113
you have track cashbox
everywhere, things can start to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1178-3
00:08:09.113 --> 00:08:12.714
get confusing where you're
handling things and you may not

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1178-4
00:08:12.714 --> 00:08:15.277
need to handle them in certain
spots and.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1197-0
00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:20.093
It can just create kind of a
mess, so you should be throwing

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1197-1
00:08:20.093 --> 00:08:23.766
all your code or I should say
throwing code in trycatch blocks

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1197-2
00:08:23.766 --> 00:08:25.457
when it makes the most sense.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1206-0
00:08:26.357 --> 00:08:29.063
O I'll kind of show what that's
like in just a second here, but

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1206-1
00:08:29.063 --> 00:08:29.317
first.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1275-0
00:08:30.687 --> 00:08:33.995
We'll go ahead and walk through
this real quick here. What I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1275-1
00:08:33.995 --> 00:08:37.303
have here is I just have this
program, it's got 3 methods in

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1275-2
00:08:37.303 --> 00:08:40.774
it. Each one is just gonna print
out like it's inside of method

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1275-3
00:08:40.774 --> 00:08:44.081
one. It's exiting method one
inside method 2, exiting method

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1275-4
00:08:44.081 --> 00:08:47.281
two inside method three and
inside method three it's going

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1275-5
00:08:47.281 --> 00:08:50.209
to try and divide by zero. So
we're going to throw an

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1275-6
00:08:50.209 --> 00:08:53.626
exception there. We're going to
cause an exception and then it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1275-7
00:08:53.626 --> 00:08:56.337
should print out exiting method
three as well so.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1297-0
00:08:57.687 --> 00:09:01.176
Assuming this works, I'm just
going to make it not have a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1297-1
00:09:01.176 --> 00:09:04.666
problem. We'll go ahead and
actually continue through and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1297-2
00:09:04.666 --> 00:09:05.087
run it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1383-0
00:09:05.997 --> 00:09:09.235
Except that's not what I wanted.
There you go. OK, so if nothing

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1383-1
00:09:09.235 --> 00:09:12.424
wrong happens. What this looks
like here, you should say inside

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1383-2
00:09:12.424 --> 00:09:15.512
main method, which is what we
happened first. The first thing

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1383-3
00:09:15.512 --> 00:09:18.402
we do in the main method is
we're calling method one. I'm

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1383-4
00:09:18.402 --> 00:09:21.590
nesting these. So inside method
one it's gonna call method two.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1383-5
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.579
Inside method two it's gonna
call method three and method 3

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1383-6
00:09:24.579 --> 00:09:27.767
is gonna do some math and print
out the result. So what you see

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1383-7
00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:31.006
here at the bottom, it's saying
it's inside method or inside the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1383-8
00:09:31.006 --> 00:09:34.194
main method. It was inside one
inside two and then while it was

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1383-9
00:09:34.194 --> 00:09:36.087
inside method three, we did the
math.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1438-0
00:09:36.167 --> 00:09:39.404
You did 5 / 1, so the answer is
5 and then we're exiting, so

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1438-1
00:09:39.404 --> 00:09:42.694
you'll see it'll work its way
back out so it says exit method

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1438-2
00:09:42.694 --> 00:09:45.984
3 exiting method two, method one
and then finally exiting the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1438-3
00:09:45.984 --> 00:09:49.168
main method. So it goes inside
all of those because they're

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1438-4
00:09:49.168 --> 00:09:52.458
nested, comes right back out.
Now inside that furthest one in

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1438-5
00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:55.377
method three, I'm going to throw
an exception in here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1534-0
00:09:56.077 --> 00:09:59.285
Now if you see I have try catch
blocks, they're on every single

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1534-1
00:09:59.285 --> 00:10:02.443
basically chunk we have here. I
have one within each method as

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1534-2
00:10:02.443 --> 00:10:05.651
well as the main method there.
So what that will look like if I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1534-3
00:10:05.651 --> 00:10:08.808
run it is. You'll see it says
inside main method inside method

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1534-4
00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:12.066
one method two method three and
then it's gonna actually tell us

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1534-5
00:10:12.066 --> 00:10:15.224
we have an exception. We try to
divide by zero so it's telling

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1534-6
00:10:15.224 --> 00:10:18.232
us this right here arithmetic
exception in module 4 lesson.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1534-7
00:10:18.232 --> 00:10:21.189
And I actually have it tell us
what line we're at. So if I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1534-8
00:10:21.189 --> 00:10:24.347
click on it, it will highlight
the line that we have the error

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1534-9
00:10:24.347 --> 00:10:24.497
at.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1559-0
00:10:25.367 --> 00:10:28.461
It's really useful to have. I
suggest taking this line and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1559-1
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:31.397
putting it in your programs
whenever you want to handle

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1559-2
00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:34.701
exceptions, because if you do
have one, it'll tell you exactly

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1559-3
00:10:34.701 --> 00:10:35.697
where it came from.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1572-0
00:10:36.777 --> 00:10:39.681
So anyway, so we're going in
there. It actually prints out

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1572-1
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:39.927
that.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1661-0
00:10:41.987 --> 00:10:45.335
I'm sorry it doesn't print the
result out because the exception

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1661-1
00:10:45.335 --> 00:10:48.264
happened aligned 40, so it
doesn't make it that far. It

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1661-2
00:10:48.264 --> 00:10:51.455
jumps out of the into the catch
block and then it prints out

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1661-3
00:10:51.455 --> 00:10:54.751
what the exception was. But as
you can see it continues on. It

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1661-4
00:10:54.751 --> 00:10:58.047
goes and says OK, we're exiting
method three and then it works

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1661-5
00:10:58.047 --> 00:11:01.290
its way all the way back up.
Method Two, method one blah blah

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1661-6
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.324
blah all the way out so that
works as expected here where

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1661-7
00:11:04.324 --> 00:11:07.672
we're catching that exception in
method 3 and that's where it's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1661-8
00:11:07.672 --> 00:11:10.497
actually printing it out. But
since we're handling it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1661-9
00:11:10.497 --> 00:11:11.857
properly, it can actually.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1675-0
00:11:11.957 --> 00:11:14.922
Go ahead and continue on the
code as if it's just fine. We

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1675-1
00:11:14.922 --> 00:11:16.027
handled the exception.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1730-0
00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:19.842
In this case, we're just
printing it out, but what we can

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1730-1
00:11:19.842 --> 00:11:22.865
also do is throw that exception
if we don't want to actually

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1730-2
00:11:22.865 --> 00:11:25.789
handle it at this point and
we'll see what that looks like

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1730-3
00:11:25.789 --> 00:11:29.061
right here. So I'm gonna comment
that out. Instead. I'm gonna say

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1730-4
00:11:29.061 --> 00:11:31.985
throw E I'm throwing that
exception. That object there. So

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1730-5
00:11:31.985 --> 00:11:34.017
now I'm gonna go ahead and run
it again.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1809-0
00:11:35.057 --> 00:11:38.351
And you'll see now I have inside
main method inside method one

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1809-1
00:11:38.351 --> 00:11:41.593
method two method three it threw
this exception which we were

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1809-2
00:11:41.593 --> 00:11:44.731
expecting right dividing by
zero. But now instead of saying

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1809-3
00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:47.973
exit method three it just goes
exit method two method one and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1809-4
00:11:47.973 --> 00:11:51.110
then main method and that's
because in this part we decided

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1809-5
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.038
to say hey, we're not gonna
handle it right here. We're

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1809-6
00:11:54.038 --> 00:11:57.176
gonna pass it out. We're going
to bubble up to the top. And

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1809-7
00:11:57.176 --> 00:12:00.418
which case the next try catch
block is gonna be inside method

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1809-8
00:12:00.418 --> 00:12:00.627
too.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1817-0
00:12:01.497 --> 00:12:03.677
So that's what we see here in
method 2.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1896-0
00:12:05.137 --> 00:12:08.418
That is being caught and it's
actually just able to continue

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1896-1
00:12:08.418 --> 00:12:11.484
on. So because we're throwing
it. So we're gonna go into

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1896-2
00:12:11.484 --> 00:12:14.658
method 2 here. And you know
what? Maybe I should just walk

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1896-3
00:12:14.658 --> 00:12:18.154
through it. But you can see that
it actually says exiting method

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1896-4
00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:21.381
too. So what actually ran that
code? It continues along and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1896-5
00:12:21.381 --> 00:12:24.878
then we go to method one exiting
method one and then finally the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1896-6
00:12:24.878 --> 00:12:28.428
main method. So the only code it
didn't actually hit was the part

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1896-7
00:12:28.428 --> 00:12:31.601
that it is the part after
directly after it messed up with

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1896-8
00:12:31.601 --> 00:12:34.237
the dividing by zero because it
didn't hit this.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1912-0
00:12:34.377 --> 00:12:36.781
But once we finally did it, we
were able to catch it, and then

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1912-1
00:12:36.781 --> 00:12:38.917
we could just basically pass
that along all the way up.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1917-0
00:12:40.297 --> 00:12:41.967
So I could also.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1922-0
00:12:44.967 --> 00:12:45.977
Let's see here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1932-0
00:12:50.497 --> 00:12:53.247
We'll just go through it there,
alright inside method.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1945-0
00:12:53.977 --> 00:12:57.147
Ah, that's because I just
stepped over it. Alright, let's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1945-1
00:12:57.147 --> 00:12:57.967
try this again.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1951-0
00:12:59.027 --> 00:13:01.027
Alright, step into it here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1991-0
00:13:02.037 --> 00:13:04.925
Just kidding. Not that one.
Alright, step into this on

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1991-1
00:13:04.925 --> 00:13:08.180
method one. OK, we're gonna step
into method two, so we're in

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1991-2
00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.330
method two. We're gonna step
into method 3. Alright, so now

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/1991-3
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.427
we're inside. Method three.
We're going to divide by zero.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2046-0
00:13:15.717 --> 00:13:18.671
And it catches it, but since
we're not actually handling it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2046-1
00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:21.723
here, we're just throwing it,
right? So this means we're just

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2046-2
00:13:21.723 --> 00:13:24.726
passing it back along. We're
gonna say, hey, we're not gonna

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2046-3
00:13:24.726 --> 00:13:27.975
handle this. And this one, we're
just gonna continue. That's what

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2046-4
00:13:27.975 --> 00:13:31.125
it's doing here. So when we step
into that or over this, you'll

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2046-5
00:13:31.125 --> 00:13:34.325
see that it bounces back and it
catches it in the method. Two is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2046-6
00:13:34.325 --> 00:13:34.817
catchment.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2053-0
00:13:35.137 --> 00:13:37.367
Yeah, catch my or catch block
here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2134-0
00:13:38.617 --> 00:13:42.022
And now what that looks like is
it just jumps into here and this

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2134-1
00:13:42.022 --> 00:13:45.428
is now where it prints out that
exception. O. If you saw that it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2134-2
00:13:45.428 --> 00:13:48.728
went from this throw E straight
into method two. That's why we

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2134-3
00:13:48.728 --> 00:13:51.557
weren't able to print out
exiting method 3 because we

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2134-4
00:13:51.557 --> 00:13:54.962
never made it that far. Instead
we just bounced it out. Just say

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2134-5
00:13:54.962 --> 00:13:58.263
hey, no catch that in the one
above this which is here. So now

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2134-6
00:13:58.263 --> 00:14:01.458
it can print it out. And now
we've handled it properly which

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2134-7
00:14:01.458 --> 00:14:04.654
means we can actually continue
on with our codes saying exit

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2134-8
00:14:04.654 --> 00:14:08.007
method two and then it will go
on and and then say exit method.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2207-0
00:14:08.157 --> 00:14:11.398
Non blah blah. If you notice
when I was when it was just here

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2207-1
00:14:11.398 --> 00:14:14.849
it actually skipped over line 22
it didn't print out anything and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2207-2
00:14:14.849 --> 00:14:17.776
that's because we already
handled it. So there was not.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2207-3
00:14:17.776 --> 00:14:21.018
There wasn't an exception that
needed to be caught because we

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2207-4
00:14:21.018 --> 00:14:24.259
already handled it. So that's
why it's bubbling back out here

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2207-5
00:14:24.259 --> 00:14:27.709
and it's saying, hey, all right,
cool. We've got all these. We're

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2207-6
00:14:27.709 --> 00:14:31.160
exiting the methods properly and
so on. So that's what that looks

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2207-7
00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.035
like if we throw it. This just
allows it to be handled

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2207-8
00:14:34.035 --> 00:14:37.067
elsewhere and not directly where
we've caught it here so.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2214-0
00:14:37.967 --> 00:14:40.287
The other thing I wanted to
point out then is.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2229-0
00:14:41.107 --> 00:14:46.157
I guess what would you use case
be to not want to have it?

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2280-0
00:14:47.727 --> 00:14:50.943
Inside of basically every
method, right? We only want it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2280-1
00:14:50.943 --> 00:14:54.498
to be in a specific place. We
don't wanna just dump everything

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2280-2
00:14:54.498 --> 00:14:57.828
in a try block. We have a
specific use case we want for it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2280-3
00:14:57.828 --> 00:15:01.383
that would make sense to put it
in a very specific area and in

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2280-4
00:15:01.383 --> 00:15:04.938
this case I have this program
here. This one is just finishing

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2280-5
00:15:04.938 --> 00:15:06.687
up, so hopefully it works here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2384-0
00:15:07.677 --> 00:15:10.667
I just have a wire loop, right?
So it's basically just taking

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2384-1
00:15:10.667 --> 00:15:13.126
inputs just like your BMI
programs. I think you'll

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2384-2
00:15:13.126 --> 00:15:16.020
actually have to start doing
this one. I don't think you've

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2384-3
00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.010
had to loop through it yet, but
you will. You'll have to loop

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2384-4
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.952
through the inputs so you can
take it repeatedly. So I guess

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2384-5
00:15:21.952 --> 00:15:24.893
you could probably use this to
help you. Alright, so this is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2384-6
00:15:24.893 --> 00:15:27.835
asking for your name, your age
and your years, and then like

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2384-7
00:15:27.835 --> 00:15:30.680
your favorite color. However,
right after it asks your age

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2384-8
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.767
when it takes that input, it's
gonna go ahead and print the age

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2384-9
00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:36.612
out, but in order to do that I'm
converting it first to an

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2384-10
00:15:36.612 --> 00:15:37.287
integer value.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2457-0
00:15:38.977 --> 00:15:42.433
Let me just fix this right here
already have a problem. Alright,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2457-1
00:15:42.433 --> 00:15:45.464
it's gonna convert it to an
integer value and I'm taking

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2457-2
00:15:45.464 --> 00:15:48.494
them as a string for the input.
So assuming that type in

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2457-3
00:15:48.494 --> 00:15:51.791
something that isn't a number it
should cause an exception to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2457-4
00:15:51.791 --> 00:15:54.609
happen and we'll see what
happens with that. So that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2457-5
00:15:54.609 --> 00:15:57.693
happens directly after you enter
your age. It will do the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2457-6
00:15:57.693 --> 00:16:00.936
calculations and then after that
it's going to ask what your

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2457-7
00:16:00.936 --> 00:16:04.445
favorite color is and then after
that it will say press Q to quit

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2457-8
00:16:04.445 --> 00:16:05.987
or any other key to continue.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2476-0
00:16:07.907 --> 00:16:12.013
I hope it works because I didn't
actually test it yet and I did

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2476-1
00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:15.477
it really quickly. So alright,
so let's go ahead and.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2483-0
00:16:16.507 --> 00:16:17.817
Let me see if I can.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2496-0
00:16:18.777 --> 00:16:21.487
Put a breakpoint and we'll see
what happens. I'm curious now.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2503-0
00:16:22.477 --> 00:16:25.727
And let's see here favorite
color.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2532-0
00:16:26.987 --> 00:16:29.908
Blue. Sure. OK. So then if I
press a key, it's going to loop

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2532-1
00:16:29.908 --> 00:16:32.782
through it, all right, this is
what we want to see. So it's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2532-2
00:16:32.782 --> 00:16:34.937
gonna continuously loop through
it actually.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2538-0
00:16:36.847 --> 00:16:37.937
I guess I'm not really.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2551-0
00:16:39.587 --> 00:16:43.083
I don't really need this here,
alright? I guess that was only

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2551-1
00:16:43.083 --> 00:16:43.647
matter so.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2553-0
00:16:44.827 --> 00:16:45.297
OK.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2573-0
00:16:47.017 --> 00:16:53.658
For blue and we can just keep
continuing, I guess I can just

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2573-1
00:16:53.658 --> 00:16:57.577
press enter, let's say John 50
and.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2629-0
00:16:58.647 --> 00:17:02.386
Green. OK, so it'll keep looping
through this and it's just fine.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2629-1
00:17:02.386 --> 00:17:06.069
So if I were to continue though,
and I enter a value that is not

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2629-2
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:09.072
a number, let's see what
happens. All right, so it's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2629-3
00:17:09.072 --> 00:17:12.358
gonna say incorrect value.
Please try again and then it's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2629-4
00:17:12.358 --> 00:17:16.041
gonna ask us for the name again.
It's gonna start over right? In

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2629-5
00:17:16.041 --> 00:17:17.797
which case, maybe we'll fix it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2639-0
00:17:18.647 --> 00:17:21.277
And we'll actually do the age
right and we'll say.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2655-0
00:17:21.697 --> 00:17:25.751
UH-45 favorite color is, let's
say, it's also green, and we're

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2655-1
00:17:25.751 --> 00:17:28.647
going to go ahead and quit this
time around.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2678-0
00:17:29.587 --> 00:17:33.564
And it didn't quit. OK, so that
obviously it's something that I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2678-1
00:17:33.564 --> 00:17:37.416
need to fix. OK, so my point
that I wanna show here though is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2678-2
00:17:37.416 --> 00:17:37.727
that.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2717-0
00:17:38.567 --> 00:17:41.995
What how it handles this
exception here? So I'm gonna put

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2717-1
00:17:41.995 --> 00:17:45.601
this break point right here
where it's at and we're gonna go

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2717-2
00:17:45.601 --> 00:17:49.088
ahead and debug it and you'll
see what's happening and why

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2717-3
00:17:49.088 --> 00:17:51.807
this is kind of a special
situation, I guess.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2728-0
00:17:54.067 --> 00:17:58.577
Alright, I think I'm alright, so
I'll continue here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2753-0
00:18:00.377 --> 00:18:04.072
Alright, I'm gonna go ahead and
mess it up already. Alright? So

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2753-1
00:18:04.072 --> 00:18:07.709
right now I entered my age and
it's gonna go ahead and try and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2753-2
00:18:07.709 --> 00:18:09.787
convert that into an integer
value.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2765-0
00:18:10.827 --> 00:18:13.052
Umm. Let's see here. First I
want to make sure I'm not

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2765-1
00:18:13.052 --> 00:18:13.537
missing any.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2775-0
00:18:15.497 --> 00:18:18.117
OK, it's going to first try
convert it to an integer value.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2862-0
00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:22.706
In which case it can't, right?
So it's not going to be able to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2862-1
00:18:22.706 --> 00:18:26.144
print out your age is whatever
the age is, right? So when I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2862-2
00:18:26.144 --> 00:18:29.639
step in, when I step over that
you can see it bounced out of

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2862-3
00:18:29.639 --> 00:18:32.847
the method because I'm not
catching anything inside the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2862-4
00:18:32.847 --> 00:18:36.399
print age method right here. So
that means that it's going to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2862-5
00:18:36.399 --> 00:18:39.951
bubble up outside of that print
age method. And fortunately I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2862-6
00:18:39.951 --> 00:18:43.274
have that method call right
here, line 19 inside of a try

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2862-7
00:18:43.274 --> 00:18:46.998
block, which means now I'm going
to catch it properly. And which

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2862-8
00:18:46.998 --> 00:18:48.717
case, I'm gonna say incorrect.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2880-0
00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:51.725
They please try again and then
directly after that I'm going to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2880-1
00:18:51.725 --> 00:18:54.567
say continue and that means it's
going to start the loop over.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2931-0
00:18:56.027 --> 00:18:59.689
So this is where I want to
handle it, because if I handle

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2931-1
00:18:59.689 --> 00:19:03.414
it inside of here, it's not
gonna return the result like I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2931-2
00:19:03.414 --> 00:19:07.518
want like like. I'm sorry what I
want to do is I want to ask the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2931-3
00:19:07.518 --> 00:19:11.496
user to just start over, retype
it right, but that's not gonna

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2931-4
00:19:11.496 --> 00:19:15.347
be something I can easily do
from inside the method because.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2969-0
00:19:15.777 --> 00:19:19.337
Umm my loop is outside of it, so
the easiest way for me to do

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2969-1
00:19:19.337 --> 00:19:22.840
that is to just catch that in my
loop right here rather than

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2969-2
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.114
inside my method. Because
imagine if I put the try catch

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/2969-3
00:19:26.114 --> 00:19:29.387
in here and then I said OK and
correct value. Try again.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3053-0
00:19:30.317 --> 00:19:33.657
It's not gonna like know that it
needs to go back to the loop

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3053-1
00:19:33.657 --> 00:19:36.620
again. It's just gonna keep
continuing and and try and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3053-2
00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.798
proceed forward with it. It's
not gonna have register that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3053-3
00:19:39.798 --> 00:19:42.761
properly. The flow of our
program isn't being properly

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3053-4
00:19:42.761 --> 00:19:46.209
executed. So that's why I have
the try catch block here instead

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3053-5
00:19:46.209 --> 00:19:49.549
of inside the part where it's
actually converting. Excuse me,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3053-6
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:52.835
it's actually converting it.
We're normally you think that's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3053-7
00:19:52.835 --> 00:19:55.906
where you put it, right? We
wanna put code inside of our

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3053-8
00:19:55.906 --> 00:19:58.923
tribe block that we could
reasonably expect to catch an

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3053-9
00:19:58.923 --> 00:20:01.347
exception or to have some type
of a problem.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3091-0
00:20:02.057 --> 00:20:05.003
But in this case I don't want to
actually catch it in the print

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3091-1
00:20:05.003 --> 00:20:07.995
age part. I want it to bubble up
so that I when I do catch it in

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3091-2
00:20:07.995 --> 00:20:11.033
the loop, I can very easily just
say try again and start the loop

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3091-3
00:20:11.033 --> 00:20:13.427
over and that's the whole point
of this right here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3159-0
00:20:14.267 --> 00:20:17.316
So in this case I could just go
through continue. You can see

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3159-1
00:20:17.316 --> 00:20:20.070
continue just brings me right
back to the beginning. It

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3159-2
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:23.266
doesn't even ask for my favorite
color. It doesn't ask for me to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3159-3
00:20:23.266 --> 00:20:26.315
print out the queue character or
anything like that because I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3159-4
00:20:26.315 --> 00:20:29.511
just want you to start over also
that would be important because

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3159-5
00:20:29.511 --> 00:20:32.511
imagine if I wanted to also do
something with that age value

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3159-6
00:20:32.511 --> 00:20:35.511
after I've taken that in. If I
try to do something with that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3159-7
00:20:35.511 --> 00:20:38.707
value outside of this try catch
block and I didn't say continue.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3194-0
00:20:39.567 --> 00:20:41.963
I could have more more
exceptions that it would happen

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3194-1
00:20:41.963 --> 00:20:44.839
because maybe my value wouldn't.
Well, obviously it wouldn't be a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3194-2
00:20:44.839 --> 00:20:47.540
number in this case. It would be
letters. So if I tried to do

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3194-3
00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.457
more stuff with it, I'd have
more problems.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3228-0
00:20:50.607 --> 00:20:53.887
So that's another reason why we
would want to actually handle it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3228-1
00:20:53.887 --> 00:20:56.763
properly and just have them
start over again rather than

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3228-2
00:20:56.763 --> 00:20:59.891
continuing along with the code
to enter their favorite color.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3228-3
00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:01.657
So that's what this is doing
here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3231-0
00:21:03.777 --> 00:21:04.207
All right.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3243-0
00:21:04.867 --> 00:21:09.495
I'll make sure that that queue
thing works before I submit

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3243-1
00:21:09.495 --> 00:21:09.887
this.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3257-0
00:21:11.247 --> 00:21:16.011
For you guys to use if you want.
Alright, wow, wait too much time

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3257-1
00:21:16.011 --> 00:21:16.877
on that, OK?

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3269-0
00:21:18.247 --> 00:21:22.065
Course Friday to assignment, uh
module 3, assignment module 4

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3269-1
00:21:22.065 --> 00:21:23.297
content. OK alright.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3275-0
00:21:23.967 --> 00:21:26.467
Cool. Let's get to that then.
Let's see.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3315-0
00:21:29.297 --> 00:21:32.786
The no. But the lessons we're
going to do the project 1st

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3315-1
00:21:32.786 --> 00:21:36.395
module 3 be my calculator.
Alright, so this one I think the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3315-2
00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:39.884
biggest issues people were
having are gonna be with where

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3315-3
00:21:39.884 --> 00:21:41.087
do I put everything?

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3317-0
00:21:41.777 --> 00:21:43.197
And.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3361-0
00:21:43.927 --> 00:21:47.070
What do I do with my finally
block? And there's a couple of

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3361-1
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:50.266
issues that can come up with how
you decide to do it in this

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3361-2
00:21:50.266 --> 00:21:53.671
solution here and this example I
put essentially everything that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3361-3
00:21:53.671 --> 00:21:56.866
I could in the try block. This
is really kind of the easiest

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3361-4
00:21:56.866 --> 00:21:57.547
way to do it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3375-0
00:21:58.617 --> 00:22:00.679
It really doesn't matter if you
have, you know, the best

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3375-1
00:22:00.679 --> 00:22:02.307
practice of where you're putting
your stuff.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3462-0
00:22:03.487 --> 00:22:06.411
All I really wanna see is that
you're using it properly. You're

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3462-1
00:22:06.411 --> 00:22:09.198
not just throwing in an empty
try catch block somewhere, but

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3462-2
00:22:09.198 --> 00:22:12.213
you're actually using it O. This
is what I'm doing. Everything is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3462-3
00:22:12.213 --> 00:22:14.955
inside the try block, so if
anything were to happen at all,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3462-4
00:22:14.955 --> 00:22:17.742
I would catch that and then it
would just print out what the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3462-5
00:22:17.742 --> 00:22:20.574
exception is and then and then
finally block. I'm closing the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3462-6
00:22:20.574 --> 00:22:23.407
scanner. This is what I wanted
to see something happening and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3462-7
00:22:23.407 --> 00:22:26.285
finally block that makes sense
and in my case I'm closing this

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3462-8
00:22:26.285 --> 00:22:28.844
scanner and then I'm also
printing out a message saying

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3462-9
00:22:28.844 --> 00:22:31.037
yeah, you completed it or know
it had an error.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3504-0
00:22:31.987 --> 00:22:35.273
And they'll be the way it does.
That is, I have this string

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3504-1
00:22:35.273 --> 00:22:38.559
value away at the top here that
is hardcoded to say program

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3504-2
00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:41.352
ended successfully. So by
default if nothing wrong

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3504-3
00:22:41.352 --> 00:22:44.584
happens, it will print that
message out here at the bottom

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3504-4
00:22:44.584 --> 00:22:47.925
that it ended successfully.
However, if an error happens and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3504-5
00:22:47.925 --> 00:22:48.527
I catch it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3546-0
00:22:49.277 --> 00:22:52.542
I change that message to now say
program ended with an error and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3546-1
00:22:52.542 --> 00:22:55.455
then it will still go in the
finally block and print that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3546-2
00:22:55.455 --> 00:22:58.268
out. And now what we'll say
program it in with an error

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3546-3
00:22:58.268 --> 00:23:00.227
instead of program ended
successfully.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3552-0
00:23:02.067 --> 00:23:05.637
OK, so I don't really think.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3555-0
00:23:06.897 --> 00:23:07.647
Let's see here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3559-0
00:23:09.337 --> 00:23:10.367
Yeah, let's.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3646-0
00:23:17.197 --> 00:23:20.979
I don't. I honestly think that
I'm gonna have to really run

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3646-1
00:23:20.979 --> 00:23:25.012
through this unless y'all want
me to. But I just wanted to show

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3646-2
00:23:25.012 --> 00:23:28.605
that this is really how you do
it. The one thing that is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3646-3
00:23:28.605 --> 00:23:32.324
causing problems for, I guess,
really the main problems is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3646-4
00:23:32.324 --> 00:23:35.916
really related to scope,
especially if you wanted to use

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3646-5
00:23:35.916 --> 00:23:39.698
block somewhere like calculating
any values, right? So if I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3646-6
00:23:39.698 --> 00:23:43.668
wanted to do it for calculating
the BMI here, I could throw it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3646-7
00:23:43.668 --> 00:23:47.387
in here, right? I could say all
right, I'm just gonna put.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3688-0
00:23:47.507 --> 00:23:50.959
A calculation method or my
calculation, you know, this is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3688-1
00:23:50.959 --> 00:23:54.887
the method called. The method is
doing the calculation, but let's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3688-2
00:23:54.887 --> 00:23:58.756
say I just want to put this in a
try catch block. You know I can

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3688-3
00:23:58.756 --> 00:24:02.506
do that, right? I'll put this
code inside of here and I'll put

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3688-4
00:24:02.506 --> 00:24:03.577
my catch after it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3689-0
00:24:13.207 --> 00:24:13.627
OK.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3722-0
00:24:13.747 --> 00:24:17.674
Umm. Let's see. Should we be
using multiple public methods in

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3722-1
00:24:17.674 --> 00:24:21.537
our code or is this just going
straight forward? OK Ohh like

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3722-2
00:24:21.537 --> 00:24:25.274
creating separate methods
instead of just having it all in

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3722-3
00:24:25.274 --> 00:24:25.527
one.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3728-0
00:24:26.957 --> 00:24:28.117
Is that what you're referring
to?

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3783-0
00:24:30.957 --> 00:24:34.725
Yes, OK. Going forward. I would,
I would suggest at this point

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3783-1
00:24:34.725 --> 00:24:38.432
you either should have or. I
would suggest doing it. It's not

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3783-2
00:24:38.432 --> 00:24:41.961
required yet, but you will have
to do it anyways. At least

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3783-3
00:24:41.961 --> 00:24:45.549
creating one additional method
because we're gonna get into

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3783-4
00:24:45.549 --> 00:24:49.197
abstraction which requires the
whole concept of inheritance.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3817-0
00:24:50.237 --> 00:24:53.272
And that whole thing child
parent class, that stuff, which

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3817-1
00:24:53.272 --> 00:24:56.514
means that you're gonna need a
method at some point, right? So

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3817-2
00:24:56.514 --> 00:24:59.498
it's just easiest if you create
a method, I would suggest

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3817-3
00:24:59.498 --> 00:25:01.967
creating a method that will do
the calculation.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3827-0
00:25:02.567 --> 00:25:05.899
Umm. Or maybe figuring out the
categories? I mean I have three

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3827-1
00:25:05.899 --> 00:25:06.957
different ones here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3913-0
00:25:07.627 --> 00:25:10.828
When to calculate 1 to find the
category, one to find the other

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3913-1
00:25:10.828 --> 00:25:13.529
category you know I would
suggest doing the same. You

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3913-2
00:25:13.529 --> 00:25:16.230
don't have to but the
requirement going forward or at

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3913-3
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:19.431
least in the future assignments
are going to be that you have a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3913-4
00:25:19.431 --> 00:25:22.482
method that you have to use
because you have to implement it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3913-5
00:25:22.482 --> 00:25:25.283
in a certain way. So I would
suggest doing it. It's not

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3913-6
00:25:25.283 --> 00:25:28.284
required right now. You don't
have to have multiple ones. I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3913-7
00:25:28.284 --> 00:25:31.335
think they requirement is only
going to say one. Technically

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3913-8
00:25:31.335 --> 00:25:34.486
the assignment says using your
previously created method so it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3913-9
00:25:34.486 --> 00:25:37.237
kind of assumes that you would
have already done this.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3935-0
00:25:37.837 --> 00:25:41.503
I just suggest doing it now so
it's easier for you, but you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3935-1
00:25:41.503 --> 00:25:45.353
don't have to. I just have it in
here, so maybe you can follow

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3935-2
00:25:45.353 --> 00:25:46.147
that example.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3944-0
00:25:47.227 --> 00:25:49.657
And see how you you can add
these methods so.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/3950-0
00:25:50.717 --> 00:25:52.477
Right. Hopefully that answers
your question.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4026-0
00:25:58.627 --> 00:26:01.939
OK, let's see. So I added this
triblock here and I just put

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4026-1
00:26:01.939 --> 00:26:05.307
that that calculation part in
here, right. But now you see I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4026-2
00:26:05.307 --> 00:26:08.564
have some underlying like
errors. I have some errors. This

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4026-3
00:26:08.564 --> 00:26:11.932
one you can compile and that's
because it says here that BMI

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4026-4
00:26:11.932 --> 00:26:15.134
can't be resolved to a variable
and what that means is it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4026-5
00:26:15.134 --> 00:26:18.667
doesn't know what BMI is. It's
like hey, I can't find this like

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4026-6
00:26:18.667 --> 00:26:22.200
this variable doesn't exist. But
then you look at the try block

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4026-7
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.457
and you're like hey, it does
exist, it's right here, look,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4026-8
00:26:25.457 --> 00:26:28.935
it's a double value. I'm calling
it BMI and we're then calling

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4026-9
00:26:28.935 --> 00:26:29.377
the BMI.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4136-0
00:26:29.467 --> 00:26:32.936
Exactly be my method when I say
call, what I mean is I'm gonna

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4136-1
00:26:32.936 --> 00:26:36.350
use it. That's what we mean when
we say call when I call this

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4136-2
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:39.764
method, I'm going to use this
method here. So that's what I'm

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4136-3
00:26:39.764 --> 00:26:43.067
doing here. So why is it causing
this problem? Well, that's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4136-4
00:26:43.067 --> 00:26:46.536
because inside this try block,
all the code that is created in

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4136-5
00:26:46.536 --> 00:26:50.115
here like this BMI value, that's
the scope that it's limited to,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4136-6
00:26:50.115 --> 00:26:53.033
right? So we can't use it
outside of the tribe block

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4136-7
00:26:53.033 --> 00:26:56.502
because we created it inside of
it. So it the rest of our code

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4136-8
00:26:56.502 --> 00:27:00.136
has no idea what's inside of it.
It's kind of hidden. I guess you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4136-9
00:27:00.136 --> 00:27:00.687
could say.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4167-0
00:27:00.907 --> 00:27:04.749
Essentially, anything within
those curly braces are gonna be

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4167-1
00:27:04.749 --> 00:27:08.465
within their own scope. So in
order to fix that, I have to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4167-2
00:27:08.465 --> 00:27:12.495
actually declare this outside of
that block. So what I'll do is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4167-3
00:27:12.495 --> 00:27:14.007
I'll basically just say.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4188-0
00:27:15.027 --> 00:27:18.702
Double BMI equals zero, and then
how I'll use it is I'm just

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4188-1
00:27:18.702 --> 00:27:22.197
going to use the variable
directly inside that try block.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4257-0
00:27:22.817 --> 00:27:25.868
That's what I have to do now. So
now I have everything done

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4257-1
00:27:25.868 --> 00:27:28.766
properly. I've created it
outside the block, which means

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4257-2
00:27:28.766 --> 00:27:31.868
that scope is just, you know,
within the rest of my program.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4257-3
00:27:31.868 --> 00:27:34.817
Essentially within the rest of
this code. So I can use it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4257-4
00:27:34.817 --> 00:27:37.970
anywhere I've created outside
the triblock, which means I can

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4257-5
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:41.224
create it inside or I can use it
inside the triblock as well as

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4257-6
00:27:41.224 --> 00:27:43.817
anywhere else I want to outside
the try block too.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4317-0
00:27:44.487 --> 00:27:47.445
So that's probably the most
common issue that I see is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4317-1
00:27:47.445 --> 00:27:50.564
having trouble with. I want to
put this inside of my code

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4317-2
00:27:50.564 --> 00:27:53.844
somewhere, but I'm having issues
because of, well, it's it's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4317-3
00:27:53.844 --> 00:27:57.125
scope really. Your code having
to do with that. So just make

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4317-4
00:27:57.125 --> 00:28:00.566
sure that if you have any code
or any variables you're creating

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4317-5
00:28:00.566 --> 00:28:03.847
and you're try block and you
wanna use it outside of it, you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4317-6
00:28:03.847 --> 00:28:06.697
have to actually create them
outside your try block.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4319-0
00:28:07.897 --> 00:28:08.297
OK.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4364-0
00:28:09.177 --> 00:28:11.620
Let me just go ahead and undo
that, but yeah, that that was

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4364-1
00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:14.144
pretty much it as far as the
concept goes, you could have put

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4364-2
00:28:14.144 --> 00:28:16.709
any any code you really wanted
to install. The Triblock caught

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4364-3
00:28:16.709 --> 00:28:19.151
it, do something on the finally
block that makes sense. And

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4364-4
00:28:19.151 --> 00:28:20.047
that's pretty much it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4366-0
00:28:21.377 --> 00:28:21.767
OK.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4371-0
00:28:22.427 --> 00:28:23.907
Let's move along here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4383-0
00:28:26.057 --> 00:28:31.227
Steinmetz Module 3 now OK
exception handling. So this one.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4458-0
00:28:33.127 --> 00:28:35.853
Again, the hardest part is
probably understanding

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4458-1
00:28:35.853 --> 00:28:38.742
instructions on the whole
calculating or finding the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4458-2
00:28:38.742 --> 00:28:41.959
minimum values, whatever. So
we're just gonna go ahead and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4458-3
00:28:41.959 --> 00:28:45.448
step through it here. I gave you
the template. I thought it was

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4458-4
00:28:45.448 --> 00:28:48.719
pretty close, so it should have
helped you guys. What I was

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4458-5
00:28:48.719 --> 00:28:51.881
really looking for was that you
used the try catch blocks

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4458-6
00:28:51.881 --> 00:28:55.207
properly. So in this case you'll
also see I have pretty much

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4458-7
00:28:55.207 --> 00:28:58.424
everything inside of the try
block. Since we're not taking

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4458-8
00:28:58.424 --> 00:29:01.531
any input, I actually don't
really have to have anything

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4458-9
00:29:01.531 --> 00:29:04.257
outside the triblock except in
my case I want to.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4486-0
00:29:04.657 --> 00:29:08.133
A message in the file name block
and that message depends on

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4486-1
00:29:08.133 --> 00:29:11.667
something that happens in the
catch block, which means that I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4486-2
00:29:11.667 --> 00:29:14.117
have to actually declare it
outside of it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4524-0
00:29:14.907 --> 00:29:17.210
Which I've done here. Now if I
didn't actually have this

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4524-1
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:19.796
variable and I was just going to
like type in a string value in

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4524-2
00:29:19.796 --> 00:29:22.342
the finally block, that would be
OK and then I really wouldn't

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4524-3
00:29:22.342 --> 00:29:23.837
need anything outside the try
block.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4563-0
00:29:25.037 --> 00:29:28.057
But since we're not taking any
input, you know using the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4563-1
00:29:28.057 --> 00:29:31.500
scanner and all that stuff, you
don't really have to worry about

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4563-2
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.626
that. OK, so you had to create
an array that had a size of

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4563-3
00:29:34.626 --> 00:29:37.804
1000, which means you had a
collection of values collection

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4563-4
00:29:37.804 --> 00:29:38.387
of numbers.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4635-0
00:29:39.487 --> 00:29:43.487
1000 of them the lowest possible
value had to be or the lowest

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4635-1
00:29:43.487 --> 00:29:47.614
possible value you could choose
randomly was one and the highest

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4635-2
00:29:47.614 --> 00:29:51.106
possible value. You could
choose. Rounding was 10,000.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4635-3
00:29:51.106 --> 00:29:54.915
Then you had to populate that
array with random values that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4635-4
00:29:54.915 --> 00:29:58.788
fall within that range one to
10,000. So you need a thousand

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4635-5
00:29:58.788 --> 00:30:02.597
of those. So the easiest way to
do it is going to be what I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4635-6
00:30:02.597 --> 00:30:06.597
provided for you before using
this random class here, creating

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4635-7
00:30:06.597 --> 00:30:09.327
a random object and then calling
the ints.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4676-0
00:30:09.877 --> 00:30:14.258
Method filling it with what size
we want the array to be the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4676-1
00:30:14.258 --> 00:30:18.711
lowest value and the highest
value plus one. I explained this

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4676-2
00:30:18.711 --> 00:30:23.380
last time, but it's an. It's an
exclusive value for some reason,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4676-3
00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:26.827
so we have to say plus one,
meaning we want to.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4684-0
00:30:27.637 --> 00:30:30.167
Specify the outer bounds to be
10,000 and one.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4694-0
00:30:30.847 --> 00:30:33.467
That way it'll include the
actual 10,000 value.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4711-0
00:30:34.387 --> 00:30:37.075
Otherwise, you'll never actually
hit it, and then we just do 2

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4711-1
00:30:37.075 --> 00:30:39.636
array and it actually builds it
and returns it for us. It's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4711-2
00:30:39.636 --> 00:30:39.977
perfect.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4771-0
00:30:41.067 --> 00:30:44.604
It's super easy but easy. I
mean, it's one line of code and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4771-1
00:30:44.604 --> 00:30:48.199
then we need to sort the array.
Now this is important in the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4771-2
00:30:48.199 --> 00:30:51.324
order that you do it in. If
you're gonna follow this

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4771-3
00:30:51.324 --> 00:30:54.801
template for how to sort and
find your minimum and maximum

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4771-4
00:30:54.801 --> 00:30:58.397
elements. If we didn't sort
first, all our values are out of

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4771-5
00:30:58.397 --> 00:31:01.993
order. So the way I'm finding
the minimum element is getting

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4771-6
00:31:01.993 --> 00:31:03.997
the first index, the first
value.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4865-0
00:31:04.617 --> 00:31:07.359
Because I'm assuming it's
sorted, so if it's sorted, the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4865-1
00:31:07.359 --> 00:31:10.341
lowest number would be the first
one, and that means also the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4865-2
00:31:10.341 --> 00:31:13.371
highest number would be the last
one. So all I have to find is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4865-3
00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:16.305
the very first value in the
array and the very last one. And

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4865-4
00:31:16.305 --> 00:31:19.383
I've already got my min and Max
that'd be the easiest way to do

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4865-5
00:31:19.383 --> 00:31:22.221
it, which is why you need to
sort it first, otherwise your

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4865-6
00:31:22.221 --> 00:31:25.299
min value that you try to find
is just going to be whatever the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4865-7
00:31:25.299 --> 00:31:28.233
random value was for the first
element and then whatever the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4865-8
00:31:28.233 --> 00:31:31.071
random value was for the last
one. And there's no limit to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4865-9
00:31:31.071 --> 00:31:33.860
like what that could be. It
could be anything from one to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4865-10
00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:34.197
10,000.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4924-0
00:31:35.387 --> 00:31:38.927
So then after you do that, you
just need to find the average

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4924-1
00:31:38.927 --> 00:31:42.236
again. You can just do the
arrays dot stream dot average

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4924-2
00:31:42.236 --> 00:31:45.892
and it will do it for you. No
need to do the math on your own.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4924-3
00:31:45.892 --> 00:31:49.490
I'm not gonna require that and
then you just got to print out

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4924-4
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:53.089
those values so you can see the
minimum was four Max was 9981

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4924-5
00:31:53.089 --> 00:31:56.397
and then it prints out the
average and we're good to go.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4941-0
00:31:57.107 --> 00:32:01.697
So testing whether this worked
or not, you can easily just

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4941-1
00:32:01.697 --> 00:32:03.797
remove the -, 1 right here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4962-0
00:32:04.537 --> 00:32:10.818
And now it's going to try and
get the 10th. Let's see. It's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/4962-1
00:32:10.818 --> 00:32:12.807
gonna get the 1001.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5018-0
00:32:13.957 --> 00:32:17.540
1001 element or index and that
doesn't exist, which is why we

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5018-1
00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:21.007
always got to -. 1 cause the
zero based index. So if I were

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5018-2
00:32:21.007 --> 00:32:24.186
to go through it again here,
that won't work. It's not

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5018-3
00:32:24.186 --> 00:32:27.769
possible because look, we have
an exception and it says index

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5018-4
00:32:27.769 --> 00:32:30.427
1000 is out of bounds for the
length of 1000.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5031-0
00:32:31.417 --> 00:32:34.975
Umm, so the the last index we
could possibly have would

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5031-1
00:32:34.975 --> 00:32:35.737
actually be.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5035-0
00:32:38.577 --> 00:32:39.297
999.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5037-0
00:32:39.977 --> 00:32:41.197
Instead so.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5046-0
00:32:42.717 --> 00:32:45.378
OK. So that's how that works.
Uh, there's any questions, let

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5046-1
00:32:45.378 --> 00:32:45.727
me know.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5056-0
00:32:46.377 --> 00:32:48.944
Umm, I mean, that's a
straightforward as I can make it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5056-1
00:32:48.944 --> 00:32:50.017
for you though I think.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5082-0
00:32:51.977 --> 00:32:54.776
You could have left in your
program the like this error if

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5082-1
00:32:54.776 --> 00:32:57.860
you did something like that and
you left it in there and I could

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5082-2
00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.564
see that you intentionally did
that. That would be OK. I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5082-3
00:33:00.564 --> 00:33:02.557
wouldn't really take points off
for that.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5124-0
00:33:03.277 --> 00:33:06.587
Ohm if you left it in just so
you're like forcing it to happen

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5124-1
00:33:06.587 --> 00:33:09.686
to say, hey, look it. I'm
actually catching it. That's OK.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5124-2
00:33:09.686 --> 00:33:12.995
I I run through everyone's call.
This is why it's important to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5124-3
00:33:12.995 --> 00:33:16.042
submit like the Java file
because I read through the code

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5124-4
00:33:16.042 --> 00:33:19.404
and I run it all. So I'll see if
you put in like an intentional

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5124-5
00:33:19.404 --> 00:33:19.877
you know.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5134-0
00:33:20.597 --> 00:33:23.745
Exception in your tribe log, so
you shouldn't get points off for

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5134-1
00:33:23.745 --> 00:33:23.987
that.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5151-0
00:33:27.037 --> 00:33:31.842
OK, alright, let's see. So first
before I get to the module 4

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5151-1
00:33:31.842 --> 00:33:34.787
stuff, because it requires that
this.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5164-0
00:33:35.167 --> 00:33:40.536
Umm, where is it? Here we go. Uh
file based operations. You need

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5164-1
00:33:40.536 --> 00:33:41.197
to know.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5178-0
00:33:42.197 --> 00:33:46.194
Where to get the content for the
assignments for file based

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5178-1
00:33:46.194 --> 00:33:47.127
operations so.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5193-0
00:33:48.347 --> 00:33:51.196
Let me show you where that looks
like here and now you can't see

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5193-1
00:33:51.196 --> 00:33:51.327
it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5197-0
00:33:53.517 --> 00:33:54.907
Let me see.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5210-0
00:34:04.437 --> 00:34:07.378
It's actually just the one
assignment. It's going to your

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5210-1
00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:08.747
actual module 4 assignment.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5216-0
00:34:10.027 --> 00:34:12.297
If you see here UM.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5223-0
00:34:13.247 --> 00:34:15.787
You'll have to go into the like
content.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5231-0
00:34:16.727 --> 00:34:19.547
Ohh you may not be able to see
this view, but if.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5242-0
00:34:20.817 --> 00:34:23.947
If you click on it, let me see
if I can change it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5267-0
00:34:34.057 --> 00:34:37.543
Right. If you go into it file
based operations and you click

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5267-1
00:34:37.543 --> 00:34:40.857
on the actual assignment here,
you'll see there's a file.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5388-0
00:34:41.737 --> 00:34:44.503
Uh, maybe not. Maybe it's not
listed there. There you go.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5388-1
00:34:44.503 --> 00:34:47.508
Alright. So you'll see this file
here. You'll actually have to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5388-2
00:34:47.508 --> 00:34:50.512
download this. It's required for
your assignment, so make sure

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5388-3
00:34:50.512 --> 00:34:53.612
you have this case. I'm going to
refer to it. I've probably also

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5388-4
00:34:53.612 --> 00:34:56.665
give this to you in the follow
up announcement as well. Just so

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5388-5
00:34:56.665 --> 00:34:59.574
you have it, but it's really
important that you actually use

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5388-6
00:34:59.574 --> 00:35:02.340
this because it's required.
Ignore the fact that step one

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5388-7
00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:05.154
says read the data from this
Seattle whatever whatever dot

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5388-8
00:35:05.154 --> 00:35:08.159
CSV. You know that's a course
error that they're gonna have to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5388-9
00:35:08.159 --> 00:35:10.829
fix. But file based or file
operations data set is what

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5388-10
00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:13.357
you'll need to have. So make
sure you download that.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5395-0
00:35:15.347 --> 00:35:17.607
Alright, OK, so file based
operations.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5417-0
00:35:18.487 --> 00:35:21.883
Probably it's operations are. I
mean the really important and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5417-1
00:35:21.883 --> 00:35:25.059
that's how you read and write 2
files from inside of your

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5417-2
00:35:25.059 --> 00:35:25.497
program.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5481-0
00:35:26.807 --> 00:35:30.946
In Java, we primarily use two
ways to read write to files when

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5481-1
00:35:30.946 --> 00:35:34.691
we can use the files class or
input output streams. Now,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5481-2
00:35:34.691 --> 00:35:38.633
typically speaking, the files
class is really only good for

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5481-3
00:35:38.633 --> 00:35:42.444
small files. It's not really
efficient or as efficient as

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5481-4
00:35:42.444 --> 00:35:46.517
using for streams, which means
that streams are preferred for

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5481-5
00:35:46.517 --> 00:35:48.817
essentially all of the file
sizes.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5491-0
00:35:49.737 --> 00:35:53.467
We will stick with using those
in our.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5514-0
00:35:54.327 --> 00:35:57.639
I guess examples here going
forward, but just know that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5514-1
00:35:57.639 --> 00:36:01.187
that's kind of a difference
between the two. You'll see why

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5514-2
00:36:01.187 --> 00:36:03.967
streams are actually pretty
beneficial here O.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5541-0
00:36:04.767 --> 00:36:08.194
Streams input output streams
are. Think of them like water

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5541-1
00:36:08.194 --> 00:36:11.910
pipes, right? It's essentially
what connects the water from the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5541-2
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:15.337
city water or the well, if you
have one to your household.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5558-0
00:36:16.577 --> 00:36:19.734
It's it's what connects it. All
right? It's the. I don't know

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5558-1
00:36:19.734 --> 00:36:21.007
the the method of travel.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5604-0
00:36:22.167 --> 00:36:26.040
Uh, so that's kind of what they
are for your data. It connects

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5604-1
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.666
your data to your program to
your code, so then we can use

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5604-2
00:36:29.666 --> 00:36:33.416
it. That's what a stream is. So
there's two primary types of

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5604-3
00:36:33.416 --> 00:36:37.350
streams that are streams that's
gonna be input and output makes

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5604-4
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:40.977
sense. One stream for taking in
values and one stream for.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5608-0
00:36:41.697 --> 00:36:42.497
Outputting values.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5657-0
00:36:43.507 --> 00:36:47.708
So each of these types has two
classes. You have a reader and a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5657-1
00:36:47.708 --> 00:36:51.385
writer, so a reader is for
reading characters like text

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5657-2
00:36:51.385 --> 00:36:55.258
values, string values, right
characters, or a writer. Same

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5657-3
00:36:55.258 --> 00:36:59.196
thing. But for writing text
value, string characters, stuff

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5657-4
00:36:59.196 --> 00:37:02.807
like that. However, an input
stream and output stream.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5725-0
00:37:04.037 --> 00:37:08.661
Umm are much more robust because
they can read binary data, which

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5725-1
00:37:08.661 --> 00:37:13.284
means that you can actually read
essentially any type of file. Is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5725-2
00:37:13.284 --> 00:37:17.697
not an image of video, audio,
you name it. It can be all sorts

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5725-3
00:37:17.697 --> 00:37:21.831
of stuff, so you're not just
limited to reading plain text

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5725-4
00:37:21.831 --> 00:37:26.104
files or any just text value,
log files, stuff like that. So

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5725-5
00:37:26.104 --> 00:37:30.307
what you can do is much more
with input and output streams.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5801-0
00:37:33.167 --> 00:37:36.801
So something neat here is that
streams will implement the auto

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5801-1
00:37:36.801 --> 00:37:40.492
closeable interface. Now I don't
know if you or remember, but I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5801-2
00:37:40.492 --> 00:37:44.183
use this terminology previously
auto closable when dealing with

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5801-3
00:37:44.183 --> 00:37:47.759
the try catch blocks and that's
because we have the try block

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5801-4
00:37:47.759 --> 00:37:51.508
that we can use by itself called
the try with resources which is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5801-5
00:37:51.508 --> 00:37:54.680
the try block with the
parentheses right after it. And

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5801-6
00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.083
you don't have a catcher finally
block but you have to use

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5801-7
00:37:58.083 --> 00:38:01.544
something that implements the
auto closeable and that would

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5801-8
00:38:01.544 --> 00:38:01.717
be.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5875-0
00:38:02.127 --> 00:38:05.773
Like a scanner or a a stream,
which is what we will be using

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5875-1
00:38:05.773 --> 00:38:09.478
here. O it's best to always use
the buffer version and you'll

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5875-2
00:38:09.478 --> 00:38:13.064
see us go through that here.
Buffering reads blocks of data

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5875-3
00:38:13.064 --> 00:38:16.650
at a time rather than single
characters bytes. It just more

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5875-4
00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:20.534
efficient. So what we want to do
is we want to make sure that we

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5875-5
00:38:20.534 --> 00:38:24.180
use the buffered version. It's
not really going to have that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5875-6
00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:28.065
much of an impact for us because
we're just reading pretty basic

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5875-7
00:38:28.065 --> 00:38:31.830
text data in our programs here
that we're going to use for our

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5875-8
00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:32.547
assignments.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5923-0
00:38:33.097 --> 00:38:36.459
But let's say you had a much
more massive program and you're

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5923-1
00:38:36.459 --> 00:38:39.655
reading all sorts of stuff.
Maybe it was, or maybe you're

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5923-2
00:38:39.655 --> 00:38:43.016
doing, you know, video files or
what have you. It's gonna be

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5923-3
00:38:43.016 --> 00:38:46.267
much better to use buffered
input or output stream than it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5923-4
00:38:46.267 --> 00:38:49.684
would be to use the non buffered
version. Because of that, so

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5923-5
00:38:49.684 --> 00:38:51.227
it'll read blocks at a time.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5934-0
00:38:52.737 --> 00:38:55.247
Alright, so now we can go
through and demo it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5943-0
00:38:58.867 --> 00:39:02.017
All right, I know it's the most
exciting part, alright.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5970-0
00:39:03.297 --> 00:39:07.907
Let's see. Usual 4. Alright, so
I really only have two here and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5970-1
00:39:07.907 --> 00:39:12.373
these two are going to be what
hopefully you can use for your

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/5970-2
00:39:12.373 --> 00:39:13.237
assignments.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6028-0
00:39:13.937 --> 00:39:16.654
And you'll have to use a
combination of the two for one

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6028-1
00:39:16.654 --> 00:39:19.564
assignment, and pretty much just
one of them. For the other

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6028-2
00:39:19.564 --> 00:39:22.523
assignment. So we'll go through
these together now. I highly

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6028-3
00:39:22.523 --> 00:39:25.434
suggest that you go through
these again. I will post these.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6028-4
00:39:25.434 --> 00:39:28.442
I highly suggest you go through
these and your end so you can

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6028-5
00:39:28.442 --> 00:39:30.867
step through them and see
exactly how these work.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6030-0
00:39:31.737 --> 00:39:32.887
And.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6114-0
00:39:34.577 --> 00:39:38.296
Run these on your end so the way
that I had these set up is that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6114-1
00:39:38.296 --> 00:39:41.957
we have essentially one that is
going to take input from a user

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6114-2
00:39:41.957 --> 00:39:45.562
and it's going to, I'm sorry,
actually right here, this one is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6114-3
00:39:45.562 --> 00:39:48.937
gonna take input from a user.
You can see I have this wire

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6114-4
00:39:48.937 --> 00:39:52.427
loop here and I'm asking hey,
enter your name, your favorite

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6114-5
00:39:52.427 --> 00:39:56.031
color, number of pets, and then
I'm going to take that and I'm

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6114-6
00:39:56.031 --> 00:39:59.521
going to write that to a file,
and it's going to be in a CSV

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6114-7
00:39:59.521 --> 00:40:02.954
format, which if you're not
familiar with what a CSV format

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6114-8
00:40:02.954 --> 00:40:04.327
is, it means it's comma.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6123-0
00:40:04.547 --> 00:40:08.377
Separated values, So what?
That's gonna look like is.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6128-0
00:40:09.497 --> 00:40:10.347
Let's see here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6137-0
00:40:11.017 --> 00:40:13.187
That I just exit out of this.
That's really weird.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6148-0
00:40:17.087 --> 00:40:20.787
There we go. Java funnels. Let's
see colors and pets.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6151-0
00:40:22.127 --> 00:40:22.847
Alright.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6159-0
00:40:38.087 --> 00:40:39.797
Sorry, I gotta open the file
quick.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6220-0
00:40:41.467 --> 00:40:44.716
All right. So if you were to
open, uh, CSV file like in

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6220-1
00:40:44.716 --> 00:40:48.371
notepad, this is what it would
look like right here. Here's an

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6220-2
00:40:48.371 --> 00:40:51.968
example of the output that I
created from this and you'll see

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6220-3
00:40:51.968 --> 00:40:55.391
that in a little bit here, but
it's all value separated by

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6220-4
00:40:55.391 --> 00:40:58.872
commas, name, comma, favorite
color, comma, number of pets,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6220-5
00:40:58.872 --> 00:41:02.411
and then I have Daniel comma,
blue comma four and John White

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6220-6
00:41:02.411 --> 00:41:02.817
one so.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6289-0
00:41:03.887 --> 00:41:07.089
That's CSV failure. All the
values will be separated by

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6289-1
00:41:07.089 --> 00:41:10.576
commas on their own separate
lines. Think of it as like rows

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6289-2
00:41:10.576 --> 00:41:13.949
and columns where the columns
are split by commas and each

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6289-3
00:41:13.949 --> 00:41:17.551
line is a row. So what you can
do actually Excel handles these

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6289-4
00:41:17.551 --> 00:41:20.924
really great and this is what
you can use to verify things

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6289-5
00:41:20.924 --> 00:41:24.525
with. But if you open it up, by
default Excel wants to open up

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6289-6
00:41:24.525 --> 00:41:27.727
my CSV files. So when I do that,
it's going to open it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6328-0
00:41:28.447 --> 00:41:31.376
In a spreadsheet, because Excel
knows exactly how to handle

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6328-1
00:41:31.376 --> 00:41:34.305
these files, it's going to
display it properly. So I have a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6328-2
00:41:34.305 --> 00:41:37.332
header row name, favorite color
number, Reds, and then I have

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6328-3
00:41:37.332 --> 00:41:40.114
the actual rows of values
beneath them, and this is what

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6328-4
00:41:40.114 --> 00:41:41.237
we're looking for here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6340-0
00:41:42.447 --> 00:41:47.422
So if you were to open up this
crime data stuff for your actual

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6340-1
00:41:47.422 --> 00:41:48.277
assignment.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6348-0
00:41:50.357 --> 00:41:52.487
It will look like this in a
spreadsheet.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6417-0
00:41:53.167 --> 00:41:56.468
Where you have all these values,
it's a ton of them. I'm not

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6417-1
00:41:56.468 --> 00:41:59.714
really sure what it's like 50.
Well, 14,000 rows. So it's a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6417-2
00:41:59.714 --> 00:42:03.069
lot. It's a lot of data. And
you're gonna sit through it all,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6417-3
00:42:03.069 --> 00:42:06.261
but it'll be pretty easy once
you get the operations going

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6417-4
00:42:06.261 --> 00:42:09.562
here. So that's what it looks
like in Excel. But if you were

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6417-5
00:42:09.562 --> 00:42:12.970
to actually edit this CSV file,
say in Notepad, right click it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6417-6
00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:15.297
and go to edit, it's gonna look
like this.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6439-0
00:42:16.137 --> 00:42:19.161
It's just not as easy to read,
but you can see all of them are

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6439-1
00:42:19.161 --> 00:42:21.849
separated by commas. They
appropriate values aren't, so

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6439-2
00:42:21.849 --> 00:42:23.097
that's what a CSV file is.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6472-0
00:42:24.607 --> 00:42:27.834
OK, so this this program here is
gonna do. It's gonna basically

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6472-1
00:42:27.834 --> 00:42:30.909
take in the values that I want.
I'm gonna ask. I'm gonna ask

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6472-2
00:42:30.909 --> 00:42:34.136
your name, favorite color pets,
and then it's gonna output that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6472-3
00:42:34.136 --> 00:42:36.657
into that file in that format
that I just showed.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6476-0
00:42:41.857 --> 00:42:42.747
OK so.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6545-0
00:42:43.677 --> 00:42:47.234
If you're going to use my demos
here, I suggest doing the output

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6545-1
00:42:47.234 --> 00:42:50.408
demo first, because it's going
to create the file that is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6545-2
00:42:50.408 --> 00:42:53.528
required for the input demo,
because if you see here the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6545-3
00:42:53.528 --> 00:42:56.975
input demo is just reading the
input, which means that assumes

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6545-4
00:42:56.975 --> 00:43:00.423
that you already have this file
created. So if you don't, it's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6545-5
00:43:00.423 --> 00:43:03.488
going to be like. Where's this
file at? I can't find it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6545-6
00:43:03.488 --> 00:43:07.045
exception and it's not going to
like it, so we're gonna go ahead

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6545-7
00:43:07.045 --> 00:43:08.577
and do the output one first.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6551-0
00:43:09.627 --> 00:43:10.977
Now if you see here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6600-0
00:43:12.907 --> 00:43:16.874
There's this try with resources
block. I have a try block right

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6600-1
00:43:16.874 --> 00:43:20.779
here that takes in this. Well
this parameters here and in that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6600-2
00:43:20.779 --> 00:43:23.941
we're actually going to
instantiate and create our

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6600-3
00:43:23.941 --> 00:43:27.846
buffered writer. We just do it
inside of there, just like that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6600-4
00:43:27.846 --> 00:43:31.317
one demo I showed previously of
the try with resources.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6625-0
00:43:32.097 --> 00:43:34.862
In this case, I'm actually using
a catch block also and finally a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6625-1
00:43:34.862 --> 00:43:37.542
block. Again, I'm putting all my
code in this to keep it simple

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6625-2
00:43:37.542 --> 00:43:38.087
for everyone.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6649-0
00:43:38.887 --> 00:43:41.730
You don't have to worry about,
you know, doing some special

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6649-1
00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:44.620
cases here. You can put it on
the one try catch block if you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6649-2
00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:44.857
want.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6707-0
00:43:46.577 --> 00:43:49.565
OK, so this is what I've done
for here. Let me run and debug

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6707-1
00:43:49.565 --> 00:43:52.455
it so you can all see it.
Alright, so we're stopped first.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6707-2
00:43:52.455 --> 00:43:55.394
Actually, first it created the
scanner because we're taking

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6707-3
00:43:55.394 --> 00:43:58.577
input and then next we're going
through the try block. The first

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6707-4
00:43:58.577 --> 00:44:01.761
part though, like I said, we're
gonna actually create this here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6707-5
00:44:01.761 --> 00:44:04.896
This is the syntax you're going
to want to use. This is how you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6707-6
00:44:04.896 --> 00:44:07.737
type it. This first part right
here should look familiar.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6781-0
00:44:09.477 --> 00:44:12.834
Sorry there, I'll make it a
little bit bigger. Hopefully

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6781-1
00:44:12.834 --> 00:44:16.074
this first partial look
familiar. Specifying the type,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6781-2
00:44:16.074 --> 00:44:19.726
giving it a name. I'm calling it
B writer equals new buffered

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6781-3
00:44:19.726 --> 00:44:23.083
writer. Now inside of that it
takes in a parameter value

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6781-4
00:44:23.083 --> 00:44:26.440
first. So you actually have to
pass in a new file writer

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6781-5
00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:30.210
object, so it might be a little
confusing to kind of understand

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6781-6
00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:33.685
what that's all doing here.
Essentially what it's doing is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6781-7
00:44:33.685 --> 00:44:37.455
it's just creating this file and
it's opening it up saying hey,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6781-8
00:44:37.455 --> 00:44:38.927
I'm ready to write to it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6861-0
00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:42.925
Well, it's doing so instead of
having to understand everything,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6861-1
00:44:42.925 --> 00:44:46.313
specifically the details of how
it's doing this, you can just

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6861-2
00:44:46.313 --> 00:44:49.756
kind of copy what this is doing
here like this line and put it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6861-3
00:44:49.756 --> 00:44:52.980
in your own. You can put your
own file paths in here. It's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6861-4
00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:56.314
easiest if you create it simple
and don't just put like your

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6861-5
00:44:56.314 --> 00:44:59.702
entire user file path with your
whole workspace blah blah all

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6861-6
00:44:59.702 --> 00:45:03.200
that stuff. I just put it in a
folder that's in my root C drive

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6861-7
00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:06.479
here folder called Java files
and I put it in there. If you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6861-8
00:45:06.479 --> 00:45:09.758
keep that I mean great, it will
make it easier, but you can

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6861-9
00:45:09.758 --> 00:45:11.507
really put it wherever you want.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6866-0
00:45:11.817 --> 00:45:13.027
The lines you remember where
it's going.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6875-0
00:45:13.957 --> 00:45:15.887
So that's what this is doing.
It's just creating that file.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6958-0
00:45:17.057 --> 00:45:20.477
The next thing I'm doing, I'm
creating so this is we'll have

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6958-1
00:45:20.477 --> 00:45:24.065
to kind of keep up with it here
with the concepts. I'm creating

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6958-2
00:45:24.065 --> 00:45:27.541
a list of lists now. A list is
kind of like an array and this

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6958-3
00:45:27.541 --> 00:45:30.849
case is an array list, but a
list is like an array. It's a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6958-4
00:45:30.849 --> 00:45:34.325
collection of values. But the
nice thing about a list is that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6958-5
00:45:34.325 --> 00:45:37.800
I'm not limited to a specific
length, I don't have to specify

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6958-6
00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.332
its an array of size 10, right?
It can be whatever size I want

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/6958-7
00:45:41.332 --> 00:45:41.837
it to be.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7059-0
00:45:43.047 --> 00:45:45.876
I can add things to it. I can
remove things from it. It

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7059-1
00:45:45.876 --> 00:45:49.059
doesn't matter. I can do all of
that and it's really flexible.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7059-2
00:45:49.059 --> 00:45:52.292
So that's what we're going to do
here because we don't know how

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7059-3
00:45:52.292 --> 00:45:55.273
much input we're going to take
in. I may ask for input 100

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7059-4
00:45:55.273 --> 00:45:58.506
times. I may ask for it once we
don't know, so I'm gonna use an

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7059-5
00:45:58.506 --> 00:46:01.436
array list here. This is what I
suggest doing, especially

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7059-6
00:46:01.436 --> 00:46:03.962
because you'll help
understanding another concept

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7059-7
00:46:03.962 --> 00:46:06.841
going forward that this is a
data structure. It's just a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7059-8
00:46:06.841 --> 00:46:07.397
collection.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7108-0
00:46:08.667 --> 00:46:12.744
All right, so I'm creating a
list of lists, which means I'm

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7108-1
00:46:12.744 --> 00:46:17.228
creating a single list, right? A
single collection of values, but

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7108-2
00:46:17.228 --> 00:46:21.373
each one of those values is
another list, right? So think of

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7108-3
00:46:21.373 --> 00:46:25.789
it as A2 dimensional array where
I have rows and columns, right?

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7108-4
00:46:25.789 --> 00:46:28.507
So my first list is gonna be
basically.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7138-0
00:46:28.817 --> 00:46:32.208
Umm all of my columns, but then
my second one is gonna be all

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7138-1
00:46:32.208 --> 00:46:35.708
the rows defining in it or all
the rows specified in it. So the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7138-2
00:46:35.708 --> 00:46:39.264
overall list is just holding my
rows. So this inner list you see

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7138-3
00:46:39.264 --> 00:46:39.537
here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7148-0
00:46:40.827 --> 00:46:43.677
Think of those as like as just
each row that I will have.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7224-0
00:46:44.777 --> 00:46:47.875
And I'm storing them in the
outer list O to make it a little

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7224-1
00:46:47.875 --> 00:46:50.618
easier, I just have everything
kind of named a little

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7224-2
00:46:50.618 --> 00:46:53.869
differently. Here I have I have
I have my variable name instead

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7224-3
00:46:53.869 --> 00:46:57.068
of calling it list something or
whatever I'm calling it output

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7224-4
00:46:57.068 --> 00:46:59.963
table. So I think there's a
table if you work with Excel

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7224-5
00:46:59.963 --> 00:47:03.113
spreadsheets or databases or
whatnot, it's just the table. We

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7224-6
00:47:03.113 --> 00:47:05.957
basically that you can use. You
can put tables and word

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7224-7
00:47:05.957 --> 00:47:09.055
documents, so hopefully you're
kind of familiar with that. A

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7224-8
00:47:09.055 --> 00:47:12.356
table just consists of rows and
columns spreadsheet, right? Just

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7224-9
00:47:12.356 --> 00:47:15.353
like an Excel spreadsheet. So
I'm creating an output table

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7224-10
00:47:15.353 --> 00:47:15.607
here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7290-0
00:47:16.737 --> 00:47:19.760
Once I've declared that because
I need to create an outside the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7290-1
00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.737
loop because I want to use it
afterwards. That's why I have to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7290-2
00:47:22.737 --> 00:47:25.618
worry about that scope issue,
right? I want to use it inside

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7290-3
00:47:25.618 --> 00:47:28.547
the while loop, but I also want
to use it outside of it. So I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7290-4
00:47:28.547 --> 00:47:31.618
mean I have to create it outside
the while loop, so I've created

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7290-5
00:47:31.618 --> 00:47:34.500
it. I'm going in my wild loop.
I'm saying hey, just continue

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7290-6
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:37.429
looping until I press the Q key
to quit right here and that's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7290-7
00:47:37.429 --> 00:47:40.027
just gonna happen. So I'm
creating the first thing I'm

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7290-8
00:47:40.027 --> 00:47:41.397
doing inside this while loop.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7376-0
00:47:42.387 --> 00:47:45.432
I'm creating that that inner
list I'm I'm creating the row

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7376-1
00:47:45.432 --> 00:47:48.735
every time I loop through this
and I take input I'm taking that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7376-2
00:47:48.735 --> 00:47:51.987
value and which is essentially
just one row of data. The name,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7376-3
00:47:51.987 --> 00:47:55.393
color, pet it's just one row. So
every time I go through the loop

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7376-4
00:47:55.393 --> 00:47:58.593
I need to create a new row. So
that's what it's doing here at

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7376-5
00:47:58.593 --> 00:48:01.844
the beginning of every time it
goes through here, it creates a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7376-6
00:48:01.844 --> 00:48:04.735
new row and this case.
Technically speaking it's a list

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7376-7
00:48:04.735 --> 00:48:07.935
of strings, right? So it's a
collection of string values. The

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7376-8
00:48:07.935 --> 00:48:10.257
string being the name, the color
of the pet.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7394-0
00:48:11.667 --> 00:48:14.954
So then I'm going to take those
inputs and I'm going to just add

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7394-1
00:48:14.954 --> 00:48:15.207
them.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7418-0
00:48:16.677 --> 00:48:19.641
To that row, I'm going to say
output row dot add scanner next

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7418-1
00:48:19.641 --> 00:48:22.127
line and it's gonna wait for me
to type in my name.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7436-0
00:48:23.347 --> 00:48:25.712
I type my name in and then it's
gonna go the next one. What's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7436-1
00:48:25.712 --> 00:48:28.077
your favorite color? And I'm
going to type that one in there.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7447-0
00:48:29.027 --> 00:48:32.549
Then it's going to the next one
number of pets. I have two

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7447-1
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:33.027
Westies.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7465-0
00:48:35.437 --> 00:48:38.271
And then that's it. That's
that's all I want for that. Now

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7465-1
00:48:38.271 --> 00:48:41.057
when I'm done taking those
inputs in, I'm gonna add that.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7469-0
00:48:41.367 --> 00:48:42.887
Uh, or I'm sorry.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7556-0
00:48:43.297 --> 00:48:46.700
Well, there you go. I've added
it to my room. So now if I hover

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7556-1
00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:49.944
over my row, I can see every
item in that collection. I have

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7556-2
00:48:49.944 --> 00:48:53.241
Daniel Blue and two right here.
Let's set out kind of like an

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7556-3
00:48:53.241 --> 00:48:56.272
array. Like so there's an array
list because that's more

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7556-4
00:48:56.272 --> 00:48:59.729
flexible, so it should seem kind
of familiar for this too. Or if

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7556-5
00:48:59.729 --> 00:49:02.973
you've talked to this in the
past, so now I can see, hey, my

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7556-6
00:49:02.973 --> 00:49:06.323
output rolled that array list is
populated, all the values are

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7556-7
00:49:06.323 --> 00:49:09.514
right now that I have on my role
completed on my values are

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7556-8
00:49:09.514 --> 00:49:12.917
there. I'm gonna wanna add that
to my table right? Which is my.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7571-0
00:49:13.007 --> 00:49:16.600
Outside list. So that's what
this is doing here. It's saying

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7571-1
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:17.837
output table add row.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7586-0
00:49:18.667 --> 00:49:22.294
Technically speaking, it's list
dot add another list, right? So

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7586-1
00:49:22.294 --> 00:49:23.937
that's what we're doing here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7620-0
00:49:24.637 --> 00:49:27.927
Add it to my table and then I'm
going to ask hey, do you want to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7620-1
00:49:27.927 --> 00:49:31.165
quit or do you want to continue?
I'm going to continue and then

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7620-2
00:49:31.165 --> 00:49:34.252
it's just gonna go through it
again. It creates another row.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7620-3
00:49:34.252 --> 00:49:35.467
Ask for the first value.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7624-0
00:49:37.697 --> 00:49:39.267
Uh. Favorite color.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7629-0
00:49:41.057 --> 00:49:43.387
And number of pets.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7717-0
00:49:44.637 --> 00:49:48.311
In this case, let's say there's
just one, and then we're going

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7717-1
00:49:48.311 --> 00:49:52.043
to add that also to the table.
Now, since we have more than one

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7717-2
00:49:52.043 --> 00:49:55.776
value, let's go ahead and hover
over table and you can see that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7717-3
00:49:55.776 --> 00:49:59.333
table has a collection of two
items here, and each one is an

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7717-4
00:49:59.333 --> 00:50:02.715
array list. Now if I click on
each one of those, I'll see

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7717-5
00:50:02.715 --> 00:50:06.040
their own set of collections
within them, right? So it's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7717-6
00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:09.888
displaying what that looks like.
Down here I have this array list

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7717-7
00:50:09.888 --> 00:50:13.446
and I have this one here, all
contained within one big array

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7717-8
00:50:13.446 --> 00:50:15.137
list, so that's what we want.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7743-0
00:50:15.977 --> 00:50:19.096
All right, so I'm going to stop
it at this point. And I'm gonna

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7743-1
00:50:19.096 --> 00:50:21.776
say queue. Let's quit it. And
now under the part would

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7743-2
00:50:21.776 --> 00:50:23.287
actually writes it to the file.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7782-0
00:50:24.287 --> 00:50:27.653
Alright, So what we're going to
do here is we're going to create

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7782-1
00:50:27.653 --> 00:50:30.812
a string build. There's a bunch
of different ways you can do

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7782-2
00:50:30.812 --> 00:50:34.229
this. Essentially, you just need
it to have one string value that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7782-3
00:50:34.229 --> 00:50:37.232
has all your or one string of
characters with your value,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7782-4
00:50:37.232 --> 00:50:38.527
comma, value, comma, and.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7785-0
00:50:39.847 --> 00:50:40.337
Yeah, yeah.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7865-0
00:50:42.097 --> 00:50:45.110
But I'm doing it with a string
builder here that will kind of

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7865-1
00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:48.318
like add these values separately
to a single string, just because

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7865-2
00:50:48.318 --> 00:50:51.185
it's easier to follow in my
opinion, to kind of understand

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7865-3
00:50:51.185 --> 00:50:54.101
the different components that
make up that CSV file. So the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7865-4
00:50:54.101 --> 00:50:57.212
first thing we have to do here
is we're gonna manually actually

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7865-5
00:50:57.212 --> 00:51:00.274
put in the values because it's
going to create that header row

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7865-6
00:51:00.274 --> 00:51:03.384
for us. It's going to say name,
favorite color, number of pets.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7865-7
00:51:03.384 --> 00:51:05.717
It's gonna be the header like in
a spreadsheet.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7944-0
00:51:06.397 --> 00:51:09.027
So when I step through this
here, it creates a string

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7944-1
00:51:09.027 --> 00:51:12.145
builder and this is just how you
create it here. So you can use

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7944-2
00:51:12.145 --> 00:51:15.263
this in your assignments. We're
gonna have to do the append the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7944-3
00:51:15.263 --> 00:51:18.283
append method and all this does
is it takes in a string value

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7944-4
00:51:18.283 --> 00:51:21.352
and it's just gonna basically
say. All right, take that string

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7944-5
00:51:21.352 --> 00:51:24.372
and put it in this string that I
have. I have another one dot

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7944-6
00:51:24.372 --> 00:51:27.587
append. OK now put that right in
the end of it every append ID is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7944-7
00:51:27.587 --> 00:51:30.607
just gonna keep adding those
values right to the end and make

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7944-8
00:51:30.607 --> 00:51:33.529
one longer string. So that's
what it's doing I'm saying add

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7944-9
00:51:33.529 --> 00:51:36.403
name. Now I'm gonna add the
column comma I could have done

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7944-10
00:51:36.403 --> 00:51:36.647
this.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7980-0
00:51:36.717 --> 00:51:40.524
All on a single append, but I'm
splitting it up here to show you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7980-1
00:51:40.524 --> 00:51:44.213
the separation of the CSV parts,
right? So then it's gonna add

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7980-2
00:51:44.213 --> 00:51:47.669
the comma, then it's gonna add
favorite color, a comma and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/7980-3
00:51:47.669 --> 00:51:48.547
number of pets.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8057-0
00:51:49.747 --> 00:51:52.889
Now the important part is after
this I need to add a line

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8057-1
00:51:52.889 --> 00:51:56.301
separator because this is what's
going to make it jump down to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8057-2
00:51:56.301 --> 00:51:59.714
the next line in my CSV file or
essentially the next row in my

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8057-3
00:51:59.714 --> 00:52:02.856
table. If I don't do this, my
CSV file is going to be one

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8057-4
00:52:02.856 --> 00:52:06.323
really long line and nothing's
gonna be separated by rows. It's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8057-5
00:52:06.323 --> 00:52:09.627
just gonna think it's all one
row of data. So it's important

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8057-6
00:52:09.627 --> 00:52:12.227
that we put the line separator
at the end here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8067-0
00:52:13.907 --> 00:52:17.677
So once we do that, if I were to
hover over the USB part.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8114-0
00:52:18.527 --> 00:52:21.578
Great. Hover over that that
string builder object I can

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8114-1
00:52:21.578 --> 00:52:24.846
actually see the final CSV
version right here. This string.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8114-2
00:52:24.846 --> 00:52:28.006
This is the single string it
created and you can see it's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8114-3
00:52:28.006 --> 00:52:31.165
exactly how I want it. Name
comma, favorite color, comma,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8114-4
00:52:31.165 --> 00:52:34.597
number of pets. Now all we have
to do is the easy operation of

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8114-5
00:52:34.597 --> 00:52:36.177
writing this to the file and.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8162-0
00:52:38.157 --> 00:52:40.863
Writing something to a file is
just a very simple one line

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8162-1
00:52:40.863 --> 00:52:43.660
part. It's actually creating
that data that you need. That's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8162-2
00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:46.549
the harder part that takes all
the time. So to do it, you just

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8162-3
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:49.392
have to call that object that
you created way at the top here

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8162-4
00:52:49.392 --> 00:52:50.217
and the try block.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8179-0
00:52:51.117 --> 00:52:54.018
It's called be, right? So just
do be writer write and then

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8179-1
00:52:54.018 --> 00:52:56.477
inside of that you just pass in
the string value.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8197-0
00:52:57.497 --> 00:53:00.966
So that's what you doing SB .2
string and then it's gonna write

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8197-1
00:53:00.966 --> 00:53:01.887
that to the file.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8204-0
00:53:03.577 --> 00:53:05.807
So now what we need to do.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8214-0
00:53:07.327 --> 00:53:10.497
One here. Let me just see some
drunk. OK, so now what we need

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8214-1
00:53:10.497 --> 00:53:11.417
to do is actually.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8287-0
00:53:12.577 --> 00:53:15.291
Loop through that data that I
had right the data that we

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8287-1
00:53:15.291 --> 00:53:18.148
collected and then print that
out. So to do that, I'm gonna

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8287-2
00:53:18.148 --> 00:53:20.909
loop through that table. I'm
gonna go row by row and then

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8287-3
00:53:20.909 --> 00:53:24.052
each value by column to print it
out. So I'm gonna use the string

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8287-4
00:53:24.052 --> 00:53:27.004
briller that I've created up
here, but the first thing I have

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8287-5
00:53:27.004 --> 00:53:30.004
to do is clear it out, which is
what you see here. It needs to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8287-6
00:53:30.004 --> 00:53:32.908
be empty, otherwise it's just
going to keep appending like I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8287-7
00:53:32.908 --> 00:53:35.717
had mentioned earlier. It's
going to keep appending to it,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8287-8
00:53:35.717 --> 00:53:38.717
and we're just have one really
big long string at the end. So.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8357-0
00:53:39.357 --> 00:53:43.658
I'm creating this loop again.
You can copy this to create your

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8357-1
00:53:43.658 --> 00:53:47.687
own loops for the you know
understand the syntax of how to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8357-2
00:53:47.687 --> 00:53:51.851
do it, but it's gonna say I'm
creating a for loop. I'm gonna

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8357-3
00:53:51.851 --> 00:53:56.289
start at the index of 0 and I'm
going to go all the way until or

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8357-4
00:53:56.289 --> 00:54:00.386
it's gonna continue as long as
that value I or zero is less

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8357-5
00:54:00.386 --> 00:54:04.619
than the size of the table. So
essentially it's just gonna go

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8357-6
00:54:04.619 --> 00:54:06.667
through every row that I have.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8376-0
00:54:08.187 --> 00:54:10.521
And this is just the increment
counter here, so that's all it's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8376-1
00:54:10.521 --> 00:54:12.637
doing. It's just looping through
every row in that table.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8400-0
00:54:13.607 --> 00:54:16.256
So for every row in the table,
the first thing I have to do,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8400-1
00:54:16.256 --> 00:54:18.992
like I said, I have to clear out
the string builder so you can

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8400-2
00:54:18.992 --> 00:54:19.947
just do SB dot delete.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8478-0
00:54:21.577 --> 00:54:24.201
We're going to talk. Where to
start, which is the 0 index and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8478-1
00:54:24.201 --> 00:54:26.784
where to end, and then that's
just going to be the length of

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8478-2
00:54:26.784 --> 00:54:29.408
it. So it's going to be the the
whole string builder, all the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8478-3
00:54:29.408 --> 00:54:32.075
text within it. We're just going
to clear it out completely on

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8478-4
00:54:32.075 --> 00:54:34.784
now if I hover string build, you
can see that I have 0 nothings

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8478-5
00:54:34.784 --> 00:54:37.493
in there, it's empty count of 0,
there's no values in it, which

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8478-6
00:54:37.493 --> 00:54:40.287
is good. That's what we want. So
now we have to append the values

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8478-7
00:54:40.287 --> 00:54:42.657
that we need, which are gonna be
for that specific row.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8480-0
00:54:43.357 --> 00:54:43.837
Umm.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8559-0
00:54:44.697 --> 00:54:48.475
In this case I have output
table. I need to specify what

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8559-1
00:54:48.475 --> 00:54:52.517
row I want which is gonna be
just essentially what iteration

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8559-2
00:54:52.517 --> 00:54:56.692
I'm going through that loop. So
we're gonna use the I variable

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8559-3
00:54:56.692 --> 00:55:00.536
here, which is just the index
value, so it's set to 0. So

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8559-4
00:55:00.536 --> 00:55:04.380
we're going to say get zero. I
mean, that's what it means

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8559-5
00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:08.621
really. I 0, which is gonna get
the first row and then the next

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8559-6
00:55:08.621 --> 00:55:12.597
get after that is going to be
the column. So I know because

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8559-7
00:55:12.597 --> 00:55:15.447
I've I created this here. I know
that the.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8618-0
00:55:15.587 --> 00:55:19.299
Index of 0 the first column is
gonna be for the name and I put

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8618-1
00:55:19.299 --> 00:55:22.775
these in comments here so you
can understand that too. And

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8618-2
00:55:22.775 --> 00:55:26.193
then the second one would be
favorite color and the third

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8618-3
00:55:26.193 --> 00:55:29.963
room will be a number of pets.
It's a zero based index. So it's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8618-4
00:55:29.963 --> 00:55:33.616
really 01 and two, right. So I
just, I know that the index of

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8618-5
00:55:33.616 --> 00:55:36.857
one is the 2nd column and it's
for the favorite color.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8636-0
00:55:38.007 --> 00:55:41.274
So once I do that and I use the
get on both of those, so again

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8636-1
00:55:41.274 --> 00:55:43.867
this gets the row and this gets
the column value.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8640-0
00:55:44.777 --> 00:55:45.747
Once I do that.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8658-0
00:55:46.757 --> 00:55:51.051
I can check and it'll you'll see
that it added the value here the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8658-1
00:55:51.051 --> 00:55:52.807
first row, the first value.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8741-0
00:55:53.777 --> 00:55:56.853
For the first column value and
then I have to add a comma

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8741-1
00:55:56.853 --> 00:56:00.140
support. They add a comma cause
it's gotta be CSV right? So I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8741-2
00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:03.587
can continue doing that for the
other two. Again the key here is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8741-3
00:56:03.587 --> 00:56:06.716
to make sure that this just
increments for each row. So if

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8741-4
00:56:06.716 --> 00:56:10.110
you have in your assignments and
you have to do, let's see your

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8741-5
00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:13.556
file operations data set for the
crime data is 5 columns and you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8741-6
00:56:13.556 --> 00:56:16.791
want to pull that in or for
whatever reason I think you have

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8741-7
00:56:16.791 --> 00:56:19.973
to read from it. You're gonna
want to make sure that you're

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8741-8
00:56:19.973 --> 00:56:20.397
able to.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8770-0
00:56:21.837 --> 00:56:24.798
Get those values for all those
comments so it won't be just

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8770-1
00:56:24.798 --> 00:56:27.661
012, it would be 012345 or
whatever. I think this applies

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8770-2
00:56:27.661 --> 00:56:29.487
more for your BMI calculator
though.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8844-0
00:56:30.817 --> 00:56:33.903
OK. So then that's it. If I look
at SBC after that, I can see

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8844-1
00:56:33.903 --> 00:56:37.188
that there's my CSV line, Daniel
Blue too. Now it's gonna want to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8844-2
00:56:37.188 --> 00:56:39.976
write that immediately
afterwards. So within that loop,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8844-3
00:56:39.976 --> 00:56:43.211
for each iteration of you going
through it, essentially each row

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8844-4
00:56:43.211 --> 00:56:46.098
you're going to want to clear
out the string builder, add

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8844-5
00:56:46.098 --> 00:56:49.035
those values for the row, and
then write it every time. So

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8844-6
00:56:49.035 --> 00:56:52.071
you're going to create that row
and write it. So that's what

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8844-7
00:56:52.071 --> 00:56:55.257
it's doing there. And then it's
going to do this one more time.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8929-0
00:56:56.767 --> 00:57:00.312
After that's done, it's going to
say, hey, I have an index of 1

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8929-1
00:57:00.312 --> 00:57:03.802
and my total size of the table
is. It's not gonna tell us, but

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8929-2
00:57:03.802 --> 00:57:06.905
it's gonna be 2. So if I
increment at one more, it's no

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8929-3
00:57:06.905 --> 00:57:10.394
longer gonna meet the criteria
of being less than two, so it's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8929-4
00:57:10.394 --> 00:57:13.884
going to exit out, and that's
what happens here. It exits out,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8929-5
00:57:13.884 --> 00:57:17.430
so there's no exception. So it
didn't catch anything. Now we're

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8929-6
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:20.698
in the finally block. We're
gonna close it. The program is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8929-7
00:57:20.698 --> 00:57:22.637
exiting, and we're all good to
go.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8969-0
00:57:24.047 --> 00:57:27.330
And the program has stopped. OK,
so now that we're in here, I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8969-1
00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:30.561
have the output and let me open
up that file and you can see

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8969-2
00:57:30.561 --> 00:57:33.950
it's right here. It opens up an
excel by default, but you see I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8969-3
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:34.797
have my headers.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8989-0
00:57:35.677 --> 00:57:38.660
Name favorite color, number of
pets, and then I had those

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8989-1
00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:41.953
values that it added there. So
it did on row by row. That's how

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/8989-2
00:57:41.953 --> 00:57:42.827
we did them here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9014-0
00:57:46.207 --> 00:57:49.958
If I wanted to actually look at
the CSV part, I would just open

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9014-1
00:57:49.958 --> 00:57:53.534
it in Notepad and you can see
here's the exact CSV formatted

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9014-2
00:57:53.534 --> 00:57:53.827
rows.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9039-0
00:57:54.577 --> 00:57:57.462
Formatted strengths. So that's
how you create the output demo.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9039-1
00:57:57.462 --> 00:58:00.210
Now for the input one, you're
just reading those values in.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9039-2
00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:01.217
This is a bit shorter.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9046-0
00:58:02.777 --> 00:58:05.147
This one is going to be.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9058-0
00:58:07.537 --> 00:58:10.579
Your assignment, not the course
project, but the actual

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9058-1
00:58:10.579 --> 00:58:11.177
assignment.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9061-0
00:58:12.097 --> 00:58:12.857
I believe.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9089-0
00:58:13.897 --> 00:58:16.868
You could just use this example.
This should be the template you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9089-1
00:58:16.868 --> 00:58:19.701
use. You should only have to use
this one because you already

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9089-2
00:58:19.701 --> 00:58:22.535
have that file created, so this
would be a good thing to keep

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9089-3
00:58:22.535 --> 00:58:24.637
note of is you can pretty much
just use this.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9094-0
00:58:25.587 --> 00:58:26.727
Plug in your own stuff though.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9128-0
00:58:28.297 --> 00:58:32.043
Alright, so the way this works
here is we're going to specify

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9128-1
00:58:32.043 --> 00:58:35.667
the file path of our file that
we're going to read. In your

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9128-2
00:58:35.667 --> 00:58:38.567
case, it would be the file
operations data set.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9152-0
00:58:39.517 --> 00:58:42.351
I think that's what it was
calling it, right? Yeah, which

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9152-1
00:58:42.351 --> 00:58:45.136
is the crime data for your
module 4 assignment. Wherever

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9152-2
00:58:45.136 --> 00:58:45.967
you save that to.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9182-0
00:58:47.337 --> 00:58:51.444
My color and pets demo thing is
just saved right here. I know it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9182-1
00:58:51.444 --> 00:58:55.424
is, so that's what I'm creating
it here. I'm going to create a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9182-2
00:58:55.424 --> 00:58:58.077
buffered reader. If you noticed
for this.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9194-0
00:58:59.067 --> 00:59:01.622
Output demo that I just did. It
was a buffered writer because

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9194-1
00:59:01.622 --> 00:59:02.487
you're writing to it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9255-0
00:59:03.347 --> 00:59:06.592
In this case here I want to read
from the file, so I'm creating a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9255-1
00:59:06.592 --> 00:59:09.443
buffered reader. I have to
create the exact same way. The

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9255-2
00:59:09.443 --> 00:59:12.442
only difference from the other
example is that I actually am

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9255-3
00:59:12.442 --> 00:59:15.687
using a file path variable and I
created that way at the top here

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9255-4
00:59:15.687 --> 00:59:18.637
you could hard code this and
just copy that, put the quoted

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9255-5
00:59:18.637 --> 00:59:21.489
part directly into the file
reader parentheses here maybe

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9255-6
00:59:21.489 --> 00:59:22.177
just fine too.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9262-0
00:59:24.207 --> 00:59:25.957
OK, so it creates the buffered
reader.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9307-0
00:59:26.957 --> 00:59:30.453
Again, we're using this whole
list of lists thing. Think of it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9307-1
00:59:30.453 --> 00:59:33.949
as tables and rows. I'm creating
that first and then I have to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9307-2
00:59:33.949 --> 00:59:37.501
read through every single line
in this file and then it's gonna

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9307-3
00:59:37.501 --> 00:59:40.830
add that into an array. So
you'll see what that looks like.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9307-4
00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:44.271
Here I'm creating this string
value here that's called reader

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9307-5
00:59:44.271 --> 00:59:45.547
line is basically just.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9374-0
00:59:45.947 --> 00:59:49.947
Umm. A string value for every
single line that we have. It's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9374-1
00:59:49.947 --> 00:59:54.144
going to loop through all of the
lines in this entire file, all

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9374-2
00:59:54.144 --> 00:59:58.275
with three of them I guess, and
it's gonna read each one. This

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9374-3
00:59:58.275 --> 01:00:02.275
loop is set to go through it
until it finds no more of them,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9374-4
01:00:02.275 --> 01:00:06.537
right? So it's going to go read
line or I'm sorry, be reader dot

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9374-5
01:00:06.537 --> 01:00:07.127
readline.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9385-0
01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:11.397
Until it's not equal to null, so
when it returns a value back.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9431-0
01:00:12.887 --> 01:00:15.339
It's not going to be null, but
when it runs out of lines to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9431-1
01:00:15.339 --> 01:00:17.751
read, that's the null value.
It'll see and then it'll exit

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9431-2
01:00:17.751 --> 01:00:20.081
out because of that. So that's
what the checking for it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9431-3
01:00:20.081 --> 01:00:22.411
Basically this whole line is
just saying hey, as long as

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9431-4
01:00:22.411 --> 01:00:24.577
there's stuff to read, just keep
looping through it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9499-0
01:00:26.357 --> 01:00:30.328
So I'm in my loop and I have
this reader line here because I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9499-1
01:00:30.328 --> 01:00:34.300
created it from B reader dot
read line. It kind of like next

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9499-2
01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:38.532
line for the scanner except this
doesn't take your typing input,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9499-3
01:00:38.532 --> 01:00:42.698
it just reads it from the file.
So read line it took that value

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9499-4
01:00:42.698 --> 01:00:46.735
and assigned it to reader line.
Here that I have and now if I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9499-5
01:00:46.735 --> 01:00:50.641
hover over it hopefully we can
see it took the entire first

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9499-6
01:00:50.641 --> 01:00:51.357
line there.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9503-0
01:00:52.237 --> 01:00:53.287
And that string format.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9582-0
01:00:54.137 --> 01:00:57.533
But this is a single string
value, so we need to split it up

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9582-1
01:00:57.533 --> 01:01:00.873
because it's a CSV format,
right? So to do that it's pretty

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9582-2
01:01:00.873 --> 01:01:04.381
easy. Fortunately we have this
awesome string operation that's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9582-3
01:01:04.381 --> 01:01:07.665
built in for us called split.
The split method we call the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9582-4
01:01:07.665 --> 01:01:11.117
split method and then we just
specify what the criteria is or

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9582-5
01:01:11.117 --> 01:01:14.680
what value you want it to split
based off of. And this thing in

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9582-6
01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:18.020
this case we're saying split
based off the comma and that's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9582-7
01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:20.247
what we're doing here. So I'm
going to.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9620-0
01:01:21.317 --> 01:01:24.767
What's what's split? Does it
actually returns an array? It

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9620-1
01:01:24.767 --> 01:01:28.510
turns that collection of values
based on splitting it from that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9620-2
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:32.194
comma value. So that's exactly
what we're gonna do here. We're

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9620-3
01:01:32.194 --> 01:01:35.762
going to go call that, and if we
see it actually creates the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9620-4
01:01:35.762 --> 01:01:37.867
array for us. And if you look
here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9647-0
01:01:39.157 --> 01:01:42.318
They're split up. I have three
different elements here. Name,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9647-1
01:01:42.318 --> 01:01:45.633
favorite color, number of pets.
And instead of being one string,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9647-2
01:01:45.633 --> 01:01:47.927
it's an array of three submit
string values.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9687-0
01:01:49.677 --> 01:01:53.776
Now I'm going to add this to our
input table, right? It's gonna

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9687-1
01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:57.811
be the header, but so it's gonna
be like the first row, but it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9687-2
01:01:57.811 --> 01:02:01.846
it's it's gonna be in that like
rows and columns format. So to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9687-3
01:02:01.846 --> 01:02:05.945
do this I'm gonna use an array
the erase class and do erase dot

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9687-4
01:02:05.945 --> 01:02:06.457
as list.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9750-0
01:02:07.137 --> 01:02:10.518
And then I passed in the array.
What this does is essentially

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9750-1
01:02:10.518 --> 01:02:13.898
just converts that array into a
list format, which is what we

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9750-2
01:02:13.898 --> 01:02:17.224
want to use because our table is
made U of lists right O all

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9750-3
01:02:17.224 --> 01:02:20.605
we're doing is converting that
over to it and then it adds it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9750-4
01:02:20.605 --> 01:02:23.985
directly. So it's just taking
this table and it's adding this

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9750-5
01:02:23.985 --> 01:02:27.257
row directly to it. It's just
doing the conversion in line.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9769-0
01:02:28.007 --> 01:02:31.697
So that's all it's doing. It's a
very short two line loop there.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9769-1
01:02:31.697 --> 01:02:33.967
It's gonna go through it one
more time.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9789-0
01:02:35.637 --> 01:02:39.208
Now when we hover over input
table we can see we have three

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9789-1
01:02:39.208 --> 01:02:41.887
sets of array lists and the
listed out here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9793-0
01:02:42.777 --> 01:02:44.157
Exactly what we're expecting.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9854-0
01:02:45.147 --> 01:02:48.803
So basically we just what we did
was we took a bunch of data

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9854-1
01:02:48.803 --> 01:02:52.340
collections of data from the
first demo we took that data,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9854-2
01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:56.176
put it into string values, comma
separated, wrote it to a file.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9854-3
01:02:56.176 --> 01:03:00.132
Now what we did was we just took
those string values, read all of

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9854-4
01:03:00.132 --> 01:03:03.729
them, split them up by commas
and then put them back into a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9854-5
01:03:03.729 --> 01:03:05.587
data format of tables and rows.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9893-0
01:03:06.647 --> 01:03:09.617
And that's what we just did.
Just bring it right back. So now

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9893-1
01:03:09.617 --> 01:03:12.683
what we're going to do through,
excuse me. Now what we're going

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9893-2
01:03:12.683 --> 01:03:15.462
to do at this point here is
we're going to basically just

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9893-3
01:03:15.462 --> 01:03:18.528
print out the values just so you
can see them. O fortunately, I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9893-4
01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:19.007
only have.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9947-0
01:03:20.177 --> 01:03:22.484
Three of them to go through
here, but this is just

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9947-1
01:03:22.484 --> 01:03:25.288
displaying those for you that
say, hey, Yep. Look, I have all

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9947-2
01:03:25.288 --> 01:03:28.183
of these roads that I wanted to
now for your assignment. So you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9947-3
01:03:28.183 --> 01:03:30.852
didn't really need that part
that I just went through that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9947-4
01:03:30.852 --> 01:03:33.566
loop. But for your assignment,
this part really applies for

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9947-5
01:03:33.566 --> 01:03:33.747
you.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9958-0
01:03:34.967 --> 01:03:38.204
I'm finding the total number of
pets you need to find the total

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9958-1
01:03:38.204 --> 01:03:38.507
crime.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9966-0
01:03:40.807 --> 01:03:43.097
What is it? It's a total.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9984-0
01:03:44.037 --> 01:03:47.405
Crime per year? Let me see what
come this expense report. Your

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/9984-1
01:03:47.405 --> 01:03:50.827
total, I guess, right. So this
will be the last column for you.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10038-0
01:03:51.537 --> 01:03:55.031
And that file you have to total
those up. So in my case I'm just

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10038-1
01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:58.363
going to say, hey, total of the
number of pets, also the last

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10038-2
01:03:58.363 --> 01:04:01.641
column in my list or in my,
yeah, I guess list of values. So

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10038-3
01:04:01.641 --> 01:04:04.812
I have like 2 and one right
you'll have like 14,000 values

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10038-4
01:04:04.812 --> 01:04:07.715
but so that's what this is
doing. I'm setting it, I'm

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10038-5
01:04:07.715 --> 01:04:11.208
declaring this first, setting it
to 0 just so I have it here and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10038-6
01:04:11.208 --> 01:04:11.907
I can use it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10083-0
01:04:13.647 --> 01:04:17.777
And then next, I'm going to
specify the index of the value

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10083-1
01:04:17.777 --> 01:04:21.837
that I want, like the column O.
In this case. I know from

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10083-2
01:04:21.837 --> 01:04:25.967
looking at the file that the
value I want for my number of

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10083-3
01:04:25.967 --> 01:04:30.447
pets is the last column, so it's
pretty easy because I can just

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10083-4
01:04:30.447 --> 01:04:31.567
say input table.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10120-0
01:04:32.847 --> 01:04:36.979
That get 0 dot size minus one,
so it's going to say hey, give

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10120-1
01:04:36.979 --> 01:04:41.112
me the first row and give me the
last index that you have for

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10120-2
01:04:41.112 --> 01:04:45.377
that row. I only need to do the
first row because all the other

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10120-3
01:04:45.377 --> 01:04:46.577
rows are the same.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10176-0
01:04:47.337 --> 01:04:51.176
So as long as I see that first
row which is the header row in

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10176-1
01:04:51.176 --> 01:04:55.139
this case and I can say how big
is it? OK, it's a size of. Well

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10176-2
01:04:55.139 --> 01:04:58.917
my case it'll be the size of
three, then git 3 -, 1 which is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10176-3
01:04:58.917 --> 01:05:02.756
2. So that means the last index
that I can have is 2. So if I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10176-4
01:05:02.756 --> 01:05:06.038
ask for the value at the
location of index two, it's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10176-5
01:05:06.038 --> 01:05:08.267
going to give me that third
column.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10203-0
01:05:09.307 --> 01:05:12.533
I know it's it's weird to follow
along with the whole 0 based

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10203-1
01:05:12.533 --> 01:05:15.812
index thing, but that's how they
all work. So if you see here,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10203-2
01:05:15.812 --> 01:05:17.477
last column index is set to two.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10215-0
01:05:18.617 --> 01:05:21.682
Because I know I only have 3
columns, you'll have more in

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10215-1
01:05:21.682 --> 01:05:22.527
your assignment.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10224-0
01:05:23.287 --> 01:05:25.527
And the next I need to loop
through it because.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10275-0
01:05:26.697 --> 01:05:30.187
Umm, I'm sorry, I need to loop
through it now for every row to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10275-1
01:05:30.187 --> 01:05:33.677
add them all up. You'll have to
do the same for you. I'm using

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10275-2
01:05:33.677 --> 01:05:37.223
this loop right here. Go ahead
and use the same loop. What this

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10275-3
01:05:37.223 --> 01:05:40.491
is doing is it's going to start
and say loop through every

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10275-4
01:05:40.491 --> 01:05:41.987
single row and just add up.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10289-0
01:05:42.847 --> 01:05:45.314
The values in that last column,
right, which is why it was

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10289-1
01:05:45.314 --> 01:05:46.987
important to get the last column
index.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10324-0
01:05:48.007 --> 01:05:51.035
So if you notice here I have I =
1 instead of 0 and that's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10324-1
01:05:51.035 --> 01:05:54.115
because I don't want to add up
the value from the first row

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10324-2
01:05:54.115 --> 01:05:57.503
because it's just the header. So
I'm gonna start it with an index

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10324-3
01:05:57.503 --> 01:05:59.607
of 1, which is actually the the
2nd row.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10348-0
01:06:00.747 --> 01:06:03.430
So that way it skips the first
one. Otherwise if we try to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10348-1
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:06.295
include it, we'd immediately get
an exception thrown at us and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10348-2
01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:09.070
that wouldn't work because we
don't want to add U the header

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10348-3
01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:09.297
name.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10352-0
01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:10.767
When a column name.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10375-0
01:06:11.557 --> 01:06:14.413
So this this is just a loop
simple loop, it's gonna go

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10375-1
01:06:14.413 --> 01:06:17.685
through every single row and in
here every row it's just gonna

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10375-2
01:06:17.685 --> 01:06:19.347
say hey look at the input table.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10402-0
01:06:20.507 --> 01:06:24.749
Get whatever row I want to be
on. In this case it's going to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10402-1
01:06:24.749 --> 01:06:29.130
start with one, so is going to
be one and then within that row

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10402-2
01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:31.147
get me the last column value.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10426-0
01:06:32.297 --> 01:06:34.845
Right. I could have put two in
there, but I'm trying to do it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10426-1
01:06:34.845 --> 01:06:37.475
right because I know that it's
the last column. So in the event

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10426-2
01:06:37.475 --> 01:06:39.982
that I, you know, add more in
front of it, I'll still always

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10426-3
01:06:39.982 --> 01:06:40.927
have the correct value.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10511-0
01:06:42.007 --> 01:06:45.189
So that's what I'm doing here.
And then if you see I'm doing a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10511-1
01:06:45.189 --> 01:06:48.473
plus equals. So I'm saying total
number of pets plus equals this

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10511-2
01:06:48.473 --> 01:06:51.301
value. That means it's just
gonna increments it or it's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10511-3
01:06:51.301 --> 01:06:54.282
gonna add to itself every time.
So this is gonna say total

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10511-4
01:06:54.282 --> 01:06:57.161
number of pets equals total
number of pets plus whatever

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10511-5
01:06:57.161 --> 01:07:00.242
this value is. So we'll see what
that looks like right here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10511-6
01:07:00.242 --> 01:07:03.424
Since total of pets was zero.
When I add the value to it, it's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10511-7
01:07:03.424 --> 01:07:06.758
just gonna be 2 because it's 0 +
2. Right. But we should see next

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10511-8
01:07:06.758 --> 01:07:10.092
it's gonna try and add one to it
because my number of pets for my

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10511-9
01:07:10.092 --> 01:07:11.557
second set of inputs was one.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10534-0
01:07:12.337 --> 01:07:15.482
Now told him her pets will be
set to three because it just

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10534-1
01:07:15.482 --> 01:07:18.787
said take toll number of pets,
which was two and then add one

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10534-2
01:07:18.787 --> 01:07:19.107
to it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10550-0
01:07:19.847 --> 01:07:22.624
And so that's how that works. So
I would suggest using that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10550-1
01:07:22.624 --> 01:07:23.827
shorthand. It's just nice.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10566-0
01:07:25.467 --> 01:07:28.281
That's all I had. So then I'm
going to print out the total

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10566-1
01:07:28.281 --> 01:07:31.333
number of pets and yeah, that's
what it looks like there on the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10566-2
01:07:31.333 --> 01:07:31.667
bottom.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10583-0
01:07:32.917 --> 01:07:35.753
So really the important part is
going to be for your assignment.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10583-1
01:07:35.753 --> 01:07:38.197
It's going to be this. You have
to print out the total.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10594-0
01:07:39.587 --> 01:07:41.437
Or I'm sorry. You actually have
to write the total.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10636-0
01:07:43.087 --> 01:07:45.806
I just printed it out. You
actually have to write it so

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10636-1
01:07:45.806 --> 01:07:48.719
it's slightly misleading there,
but you actually have to do

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10636-2
01:07:48.719 --> 01:07:51.486
output. You actually have to
output this, but it's super

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10636-3
01:07:51.486 --> 01:07:54.448
simple because all you have to
do is create a writer and you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10636-4
01:07:54.448 --> 01:07:55.467
can just simply call.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10643-0
01:07:57.187 --> 01:07:59.797
Like this right here. That's all
you really have to do.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10662-0
01:08:01.287 --> 01:08:03.933
I mean in this case I don't have
it created but like instead of

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10662-1
01:08:03.933 --> 01:08:05.917
printing it like I did, you
could just do this.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10665-0
01:08:06.897 --> 01:08:07.407
Umm.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10675-0
01:08:10.767 --> 01:08:13.047
Wow, I'm gonna be lazy and I'm
just going to copy what I have.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10685-0
01:08:32.507 --> 01:08:34.657
There you go. I think it just
made this too easy.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10698-0
01:08:38.427 --> 01:08:41.559
Yeah. So what this does is this
is just gonna write that to the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10698-1
01:08:41.559 --> 01:08:42.097
file there.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10718-0
01:08:44.577 --> 01:08:47.316
Except I just continued through
it, so it's going to be really

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10718-1
01:08:47.316 --> 01:08:49.707
quick. So let's see here.
Alright, program is exiting.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10724-0
01:08:51.457 --> 01:08:53.987
It's not say that alright.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10733-0
01:08:56.517 --> 01:09:00.927
So when you do this, let's see
the number of pets.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10741-0
01:09:02.547 --> 01:09:06.367
Crater, right. Well, I do need
to probably put it in my.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10747-0
01:09:07.037 --> 01:09:08.477
Let's try this out real quick.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10752-0
01:09:21.517 --> 01:09:21.907
Oh.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10765-0
01:09:35.277 --> 01:09:38.445
Alright, let me check some not
there. Ohh man the values all

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10765-1
01:09:38.445 --> 01:09:38.757
weird.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10771-0
01:09:42.477 --> 01:09:43.947
But that's how you have to write
it to it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10819-0
01:09:45.307 --> 01:09:47.904
You can have to make sure you
create a buffer right, but it'll

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10819-1
01:09:47.904 --> 01:09:50.584
be simple. You don't have to do
all that other stuff that I just

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10819-2
01:09:50.584 --> 01:09:53.099
did in the other table, you
know, with like the whole string

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10819-3
01:09:53.099 --> 01:09:55.696
builder is appending it all to
the output table. You just have

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10819-4
01:09:55.696 --> 01:09:58.211
to output it. I don't really
care if it's like fancy, I just

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10819-5
01:09:58.211 --> 01:09:59.077
need to have the one.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10876-0
01:10:00.017 --> 01:10:03.506
Cell that's gonna stay. Like
what? The total is, it could

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10876-1
01:10:03.506 --> 01:10:06.996
just be a simple number. You
don't have to have that. CSV

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10876-2
01:10:06.996 --> 01:10:10.726
just has to put it in the CSV
format I guess is what it says.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10876-3
01:10:10.726 --> 01:10:14.456
So just output that not printing
out like I did. So I kind of

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10876-4
01:10:14.456 --> 01:10:18.186
actually want to have you guys
work on that one, but it's all

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10876-5
01:10:18.186 --> 01:10:18.727
there so.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10887-0
01:10:20.177 --> 01:10:24.147
This pretty much entire input
demo one you can use.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10907-0
01:10:24.897 --> 01:10:27.692
The only thing you would have to
really add on your own is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10907-1
01:10:27.692 --> 01:10:30.487
actually the buffered writer
part. Writing it to the file.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10930-0
01:10:32.667 --> 01:10:35.417
Now your BMI. You know what? Let
me just go through the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10930-1
01:10:35.417 --> 01:10:38.363
assignment instructions first,
but OK. So I'm going to post

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10930-2
01:10:38.363 --> 01:10:40.867
these demos. Hopefully I'll can
follow through it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10968-0
01:10:45.387 --> 01:10:48.346
All right, of course. Bridge
assignment. OK, so for the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10968-1
01:10:48.346 --> 01:10:51.834
actual assignment, here are your
instructions. Ohh for the course

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10968-2
01:10:51.834 --> 01:10:54.952
project assignment. Yeah, the
instructions. Just one step,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/10968-3
01:10:54.952 --> 01:10:58.017
step 6. So you gotta store all
the information in a file.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11036-0
01:10:59.007 --> 01:11:02.570
You need to use a loop and keep
asking the users to enter the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11036-1
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:06.190
patients name, height, weight
and birthday. Your program needs

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11036-2
01:11:06.190 --> 01:11:09.926
to calculate the categories just
like you're normally doing, but

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11036-3
01:11:09.926 --> 01:11:13.316
you need to now write it to a
file and then because you're

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11036-4
01:11:13.316 --> 01:11:16.707
using a loop to take in the
input values, you need to have

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11036-5
01:11:16.707 --> 01:11:20.097
it stop taking the inputs once
they press the Q character.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11063-0
01:11:21.757 --> 01:11:24.734
Qki. Whatever. Umm, so that's
really the requirement here is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11063-1
01:11:24.734 --> 01:11:27.613
that you need to be able to
write it to the program or I'm

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11063-2
01:11:27.613 --> 01:11:29.467
sorry, write it to the file and
then.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11097-0
01:11:31.067 --> 01:11:33.815
Excuse me? Uh, stop. When they
press the Q character. So you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11097-1
01:11:33.815 --> 01:11:36.563
should just be building on to
your program there. So instead

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11097-2
01:11:36.563 --> 01:11:39.491
of having it be more linear with
just once of inputs, you got to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11097-3
01:11:39.491 --> 01:11:40.437
throw that in a loop.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11114-0
01:11:44.607 --> 01:11:50.427
So maybe I misspoke when I
stated this, but for the BMI.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11185-0
01:11:51.707 --> 01:11:55.241
Project I believe you only need
to use just the output demo

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11185-1
01:11:55.241 --> 01:11:58.481
because all you're doing is
taking in these values and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11185-2
01:11:58.481 --> 01:12:01.721
you're outputting it right. Of
course you need to also

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11185-3
01:12:01.721 --> 01:12:05.549
calculate the BMI and stuff, but
you're gonna be doing that just

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11185-4
01:12:05.549 --> 01:12:09.201
within this while loop. You can
do all your calculations, all

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11185-5
01:12:09.201 --> 01:12:12.736
that stuff for each set of
inputs, and you're gonna want to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11185-6
01:12:12.736 --> 01:12:16.564
save it. You could do it if you
different ways, but you could do

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11185-7
01:12:16.564 --> 01:12:20.158
it all within your while loop
and just save it directly as a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11185-8
01:12:20.158 --> 01:12:22.337
row each time, just like I did
here.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11213-0
01:12:23.797 --> 01:12:27.185
And then go through afterwards
and then create your string

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11213-1
01:12:27.185 --> 01:12:30.917
builders or your string builder
and then write it to it. But you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11213-2
01:12:30.917 --> 01:12:34.478
should only need to use just
this one output demo or your BMI

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11213-3
01:12:34.478 --> 01:12:34.937
project.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11226-0
01:12:36.117 --> 01:12:39.087
But for the assignment, you'll
have to use both like I just

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11226-1
01:12:39.087 --> 01:12:41.117
showed you, or at least part of
the one.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11285-0
01:12:42.637 --> 01:12:45.329
So for this one you need to
download that file. I already

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11285-1
01:12:45.329 --> 01:12:47.929
showed it to you, but again I'll
post it. It's the file

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11285-2
01:12:47.929 --> 01:12:50.993
operations data set, so step one
read the data from the CSV file.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11285-3
01:12:50.993 --> 01:12:53.592
That's what you have to do,
right? You have to read the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11285-4
01:12:53.592 --> 01:12:56.424
data. I just had my demo there
show you how to read the case

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11285-5
01:12:56.424 --> 01:12:58.327
file, CSV file, Step 2 analyze
the data.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11302-0
01:12:59.787 --> 01:13:02.679
Now that means is to like, just
understand what it what it's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11302-1
01:13:02.679 --> 01:13:04.717
doing like what's the context of
the data.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11320-0
01:13:06.277 --> 01:13:08.972
Yeah, it it doesn't actually
mean to like do anything

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11320-1
01:13:08.972 --> 01:13:12.017
technical with it. Just like,
yeah, it's there and analyzing

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11320-2
01:13:12.017 --> 01:13:12.167
it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11379-0
01:13:13.157 --> 01:13:16.249
And then Step 3 Add all the
numbers from the report. Your

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11379-1
01:13:16.249 --> 01:13:19.394
total column right. So in my
example I had total number of

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11379-2
01:13:19.394 --> 01:13:22.805
pets. Do you will have to do the
report your total column? It's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11379-3
01:13:22.805 --> 01:13:26.217
the last column so that should
make it easier for you. And then

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11379-4
01:13:26.217 --> 01:13:29.309
step four create another file
and write the output of the

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11379-5
01:13:29.309 --> 01:13:32.187
total crime numbers that you've
added up from Step 3.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11400-0
01:13:32.947 --> 01:13:35.978
Again, I just showed you you
just need to output that one

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11400-1
01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:39.166
value. You don't have to do any
type of string builder stuff

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11400-2
01:13:39.166 --> 01:13:41.517
just to you know your your
writer dot write.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11408-0
01:13:42.327 --> 01:13:44.447
Straight to the file and you'll
be just fine.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11418-0
01:13:49.907 --> 01:13:54.707
Umm, OK, so let's see. That's
gonna be that.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11483-0
01:13:55.907 --> 01:13:59.327
Yeah. So you just need one Java
file for this one for this

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11483-1
01:13:59.327 --> 01:14:02.979
assignment, and you'll be just
fine actually, for both. You'll

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11483-2
01:14:02.979 --> 01:14:06.515
only really need the one Java
file each each assignment. OK,

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11483-3
01:14:06.515 --> 01:14:10.167
the tips? I guess this really
isn't helpful if you just use my

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11483-4
01:14:10.167 --> 01:14:13.530
demos, you can use the code from
there, but you want your

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11483-5
01:14:13.530 --> 01:14:14.457
buffered reader.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11493-0
01:14:15.727 --> 01:14:18.858
Use the buffered reader class.
Yeah, watch the demo. There you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11493-1
01:14:18.858 --> 01:14:19.007
go.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11496-0
01:14:20.897 --> 01:14:21.367
Alright.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11524-0
01:14:22.137 --> 01:14:25.519
Discussion this one on input and
output streams. Compare and

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11524-1
01:14:25.519 --> 01:14:29.067
contrast the input versus output
streams like give at least one

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11524-2
01:14:29.067 --> 01:14:32.005
example of an input and output
stream. I mean pretty

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11524-3
01:14:32.005 --> 01:14:32.947
self-explanatory.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11538-0
01:14:34.127 --> 01:14:36.990
I just don't just stay there
like once for input, once for

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11538-1
01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:39.367
output actually specify some
differences though.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11542-0
01:14:40.087 --> 01:14:41.347
OK, discussion rules.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11545-0
01:14:42.117 --> 01:14:43.137
Already went over those.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11569-0
01:14:44.177 --> 01:14:47.503
So I'm gonna skip through that
live classroom assignment, which

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11569-1
01:14:47.503 --> 01:14:50.673
is preferred buffered or non
buffered stream. I feel like if

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11569-2
01:14:50.673 --> 01:14:53.427
you're watching you should
definitely know that one.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11595-0
01:14:54.397 --> 01:14:58.009
All right. Oh, midterm service.
OK, so by now, hopefully you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11595-1
01:14:58.009 --> 01:15:01.799
would have gotten an e-mail. I'm
thinking about taking, like, a

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11595-2
01:15:01.799 --> 01:15:02.687
midterm survey.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11601-0
01:15:03.327 --> 01:15:06.957
Umm, that is actually located.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11607-0
01:15:07.797 --> 01:15:09.847
I think it's gonna be located.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11611-0
01:15:12.607 --> 01:15:13.947
Uh, not there.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11619-0
01:15:15.087 --> 01:15:16.917
Uh, where is it? Is it in module
4?

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11625-0
01:15:18.197 --> 01:15:19.497
Maybe I'm just not seeing it.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11667-0
01:15:20.607 --> 01:15:23.879
I'll leave if someone else knows
where it's at. Module 3 it's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11667-1
01:15:23.879 --> 01:15:26.940
like. There you go. It's in
module 3. Maybe I should have

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11667-2
01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:30.265
mentioned it there. Module 3,
There's this midterm survey that

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11667-3
01:15:30.265 --> 01:15:33.378
you can take at the bottom
there. And I I suggest doing it

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11667-4
01:15:33.378 --> 01:15:35.067
if you can. It's really helpful.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11682-0
01:15:36.287 --> 01:15:40.760
It's just going to be some basic
questions about the course and I

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11682-1
01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:41.167
think.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11688-0
01:15:42.337 --> 01:15:43.797
Pretty much anything related to
the course.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11698-0
01:15:45.037 --> 01:15:47.566
It'd be great if you could take
it. Any feedback is good, good

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11698-1
01:15:47.566 --> 01:15:47.847
or bad.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11734-0
01:15:49.167 --> 01:15:52.295
It'll just help me as an
instructor to be better and to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11734-1
01:15:52.295 --> 01:15:55.927
change anything if things needed
to be changed within the course

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11734-2
01:15:55.927 --> 01:15:59.390
before they end. I'm just any
midterm feedback is always good

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11734-3
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.837
to have.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11763-0
01:16:00.547 --> 01:16:03.480
So if you can't take that,
that'd be great. It is

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11763-1
01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:07.294
anonymous, so I won't know your
answers. However, I will let you

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11763-2
01:16:07.294 --> 01:16:08.467
know that I can see.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11829-0
01:16:09.627 --> 01:16:13.060
If someone has taken it, just
not what the answers are. That

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11829-1
01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:16.492
being said, the more important
survey is gonna be the end of

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11829-2
01:16:16.492 --> 01:16:19.700
term survey. That one is like
completely anonymous. It's

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11829-3
01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:23.245
through a whole different type
of thing that one more thorough

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11829-4
01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:26.677
and that one if you're not. If
you're only going to take one

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11829-5
01:16:26.677 --> 01:16:30.222
survey, I would suggest doing
that one, that one. I don't even

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11829-6
01:16:30.222 --> 01:16:33.824
get the results from until the
course is closed. The grades are

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11829-7
01:16:33.824 --> 01:16:36.187
in. So there's No Fear of
anything there.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11859-0
01:16:38.217 --> 01:16:40.834
Completely anonymous, but it's
always helpful, good or bad

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11859-1
01:16:40.834 --> 01:16:43.539
feedback. Any feedback is good.
So alright. I just wanted to

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11859-2
01:16:43.539 --> 01:16:46.112
mention that. Please take the
surveys if you can and I'll

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11859-3
01:16:46.112 --> 01:16:48.507
probably e-mail you constantly
bugging you anyway so.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11885-0
01:16:49.847 --> 01:16:53.204
Alright, I think that will be
it. Then, if there's no

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11885-1
01:16:53.204 --> 01:16:57.059
questions, I guess I will see
you next module. If you do have

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11885-2
01:16:57.059 --> 01:17:00.976
questions, just stick around and
I'm more than happy to answer

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11885-3
01:17:00.976 --> 01:17:01.287
them.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11887-0
01:17:02.577 --> 01:17:02.907
O.

01c21699-2a97-4c4a-a4a9-61869305d9b9/11892-0
01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:05.227
All right, take care.
